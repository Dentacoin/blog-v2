It is the first and only crypto coin specifically created to be used as an industrial payment method in the field of Dentistry worldwide. This fast-growing, high-tech oriented, 500 billion USD market (p.y.), forms a real chance for an investment.<\/p>\n<p>To further increase its relevance as a store of value, each Dentacoin is legally bound to one share of the Dentacoin foundation and all its commodities. But Dentacoin offers even more: Besides being a value depot and a cryptocurrency, DCN provides value-creating tools, which are based on the Ethereum blockchain technology. Those tools, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/dentacoin-mission\/\">together with the game-changing insurance model<\/a>, will inevitably improve the dental industry providing various benefits for suppliers, patients and dentists. Simultaneously, the costs will be tangibly reduced for all involved parties.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1><strong>The Problem:<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Unfortunately, nowadays a treatment with crowns and bridges fixed on implants is frequently not a real option for most of the people due to the high price. For budget reasons, patients are forced to choose unreliable, removable dentures. With time, this leads to a number of health issues, problems with self-esteem and an overall low quality of life. This inability to pay for a proper treatment affects 1 billion people, as most of the general health insurances do not cover this type of costs. No money \u2013 no dental health? We believe this unfair reality screams to be changed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1><strong>The Solution:<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Based on the experience gathered from the real life dental industry, it could be stated that a sophisticated prophylaxis system could be a preventive solution to 90% of all dental problems, and the other unavoidable and complex 10% of the solutions could be paid by a blockchain-based insurance system. With the Dentacoin Blockchain-base insurance model, patients will be guaranteed to receive lifelong free dental services by paying extremely low monthly fees to their dentists in Dentacoin (DCN). On the other hand, dentists will be motivated to always keep their patients in a perfect dental health condition by providing them with proper care and advice. Initially, this concept will presumably not be supported by the powerful insurance groups, but we believe in time they will be pushed to find more effective options for all the patients.<\/p>\n<p>By adopting the Dentacoin concept, all professionals in the Dental Industry ensure they work for the good of the patient while also being benefited by themselves. A global currency for the Dental Industry will unite the efforts for all businesses and individuals, thus removing the middlemen, who make profits simultaneously affecting the delivery price for the dentist and the final cost for the patient.<\/p>\n<p>A producer of dental materials and a dentist, no matter the scale of his work, can now easily communicate and exchange value for Dentacoins, without the extra time, efforts and fees for dealers, logistics, importers, wholesalers and retailers. This direct connection between the producer and the dentist is established on the Blockchain, giving transparency of the transaction (products and materials for Dentacoins) and no extra fees are charged by banks. No time is wasted in terms of international transaction periods. Therefore, the manufacturers can still receive their profits and the dentist can still receive their products without paying extra for the service of dealer, logistics, importer, wholesaler and retailer. This enables the dentist to provide lower prices for the end customer \u2013 the patient, pushing the excess middlemen out of the way.<\/p>\n<p>The supplier, the dentist and the patient will then find themselves in a \"win-win-win\" situation. The only losers are the middlemen, whose high margins will be obsolete.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1><strong>The Blockchain Technology:<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Both the Dentacoin and the insurance are based on the Ethereum Blockchain. The Dentacoin follows the ERC20 token standard which guarantees real currency security and fraud resistance. The dental insurance concept and the patient health database will be developed and executed as an Ethereum Smart Contract for maximum safety and minimum operating costs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Why Blockchain? 3 main reasons:<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>1. Only contracts concluded inside the Blockchain structure could provide legal transparency, comparability and enforceability of the agreed obligations at a very low cost for all the involved parties. The contract is not concluded through intermediaries or insurance companies, but in a direct, responsible relation between the interacting parties. The logic behind is simple: the chance for manipulations of all kinds is eliminated.<br \/>\n2. Only by means of a global industrial currency (Dentacoin) the purchase of material and technology could be carried out directly between the manufacturer and the dentist, no matter the scale of his work, in a fast, cost-effective and legal way. Nowadays, it is hard for most of the dentists to buy straight from the manufacturers, since their daily workflow does not correspond to the enormous minimal order quantities (MOQ). In addition to general MOQ unfairness, unbearably high costs are involved.<br \/>\nThe modern, easily accessible and affordable logistic systems, in addition to the payments with an industrial cryptocurrency Dentacoin, will eliminate the high costs for international transfers. If DCNs are used instead of the current best practices, there will be no bank and other service fees involved. Both the lack of payment security and the transport costs will become worries of the past.<br \/>\n3. For the insurance concept developed, an unlimited, decentralized dental health database is required to secure all patients\u2019 historical data. The preparation of an individual prophylaxis plan or a highly individualized treatment plan requires a holistic view of the overall health of the patient. The patient decides by himself which doctor is allowed to access his medical history. If, in comparison, a traditional platform was used, that would allow for anyone to easily gain access to personal information and use it to their advantage. With the blockchain technology, a dentist can read only upon prior given access. This peerless security degree and control over one\u2019s own data could be ensured by the Blockchain. There is no central regulatory institution; no external decision-makers. The blockchain guarantees that the contract could not be changed and manipulated by whatever means possible. It allows transparent and easily enforceable contractual relation, forming an absolutely safe environment.<br \/>\nIn addition, the risk of inflation is extremely reduced in comparison with FIAT currencies, due to the value-generating distribution model of Dentacoin and the limited amount of the coins. Therefore, the involved parties are given further benefits as the Dentacoin value is expected to increase in time. For investors, manufacturers, dentists and patients that is an additional opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1><strong>The Success factors:<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Our team, together with all the partners and contributors from the Dental Industry, is convinced in the success story of Dentacoin. And this is not a groundless belief.<br \/>\n1. The Dentacoin concept integrates the blockchain technology in a large, fast-growing, high-tech global market with a market cap of 500 billion USD (p.a.).<br \/>\n2. The concept has low entry barriers as the main target groups - patients (a target group of 3 billion people) and dentists (a target group of 200 000 professionals) - are individuals and not large corporations that could master the market.<br \/>\n3. The interests of the main target groups - patients and dentists \u2013 have the possibility to be aligned. Further marketing efforts can therefore be applied to dentists as multipliers. After a slow but stable start, dynamic scale effects will lead to disproportional growth. This would be the starting point of the democratization of the dental industry.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1><strong>The Team behind:<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Behind Dentacoin stands a team of believers with a real world business background. The core team consists of 13 people \u2013 developers, market leaders, dentists, industry 4.0 engineers, macroeconomists, insurance economists, lawyers and financial experts from the UK, BG, IND, USA, GER, NL, F, RU and SA.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1><strong>The Dentacoin value:<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Each Dentacoin is legally bound to one share of the Dentacoin foundation and all its commodities.<br \/>\nThe issuance of DCN is stated into the Foundation statute. The Director of the Foundation has no free decision-making power, but must adhere to the rules of the Articles of Incorporation. It is allowed for all coin holders to vote for important decisions regarding the foundation. As a result, we also subject the Foundation to the public control of all DCN owners.<br \/>\nWith the proceeds from the ICO, the Dentacoin Foundation will start to develop and implement the publicly presented projects and inform all DCN owners and the public about the current state of the projects. As mentioned above, the issuance of Dentacoins is strictly bound to the rules of the Foundation. This strongly restricts the output of Dentacoins.<br \/>\nThrough the active global communication planned with the DCN owners, the blockchain community, the dental partners, the suppliers and the public, the interest in DCN is expected to grow faster than the projects could be realized. This leads to a shortage of the DCNs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Could Dentacoin be used as a mean of payment?<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>As a part of the test phase of the concept, Dentacoin is already being used as a mean of payment and as a part of a Patient Loyalty Program in partner dental clinics. According to them, Dentacoin is a highly beneficial tool for creating a community with the patients and for improving the service quality in accordance with patients' needs. Hundreds of patients have already been operating with Dentacoins.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Is DCN already accepted as a currency everywhere?<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>So far, DCN is accepted as a mean of payment in the first Dentacoin partner clinics. Our concept is still in the beginning but being so strongly bound to the real business world helps us to achieve faster development level than many other coin issuers. And the perspectives are dizzying.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Happening now:<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>We are currently in negotiation with an existing and fully funded state-of-the-art dental clinic with an integrated digital laboratory in London, which is about to be purchased as a pilot clinic in order to further develop the concept under practical conditions. The business plan of the company is valued using the discounted cash flow method (DCF) to aprox. GBP 90 million. It looks like the seller will accept the purchase to be made exclusively in Dentacoins. This would be a very big step for the DCN value development.<\/p>\n<p>The acquisition of companies or shares of companies in the dental industry is carried out under the following conditions:<br \/>\n1. If the company to be acquired can play a key role in the implementation of the strategic or operational objectives and thereby supports the testing and dissemination of the Dentacoin concept and uses it to promote the value of Dentacoin.<br \/>\n2. Payment in these cases always takes place in Dentacoins and not in FIAT currencies. Due to the acceptance of the vendor, the value of Dentacoin is further stabilized.<br \/>\n3. The proceeds from ICO and crowdsales are exclusively used for the project development. All the ICO and Crowdsales campaigns are limited to the equivalent of a maximum of 2 million EUR. No exception. This ensures that the capital invested will be used effectively and not wastefully. Only when the current project is realized, another project could be launched. The described approach is also an intelligent form of \u201cwindow dressing\u201d in the interest of the DCN owners, which would further strengthen the distribution model and accelerates the increase in value.<\/p>\n<p>We hope that this first, essentially important deal could be realized before our first ICO (Stay tuned!). Currently, the purchase contracts are being prepared by attorneys and are close to completion. For the first time in the history of cryptocurrency, a real company would be acquired and paid for exclusively through tokens (DCN).<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1>You want to know more about Dentacoin?

On the other hand, <strong>dentists will be motivated to always keep their patients in a perfect dental health condition<\/strong> by providing them with proper care and advice. Subsequently, if the patient\u2019s health condition is not maintained to standard by the dentist, the costs that arise thereafter will have to be covered by the dentist him\/herself.<\/p>\n<p>This need for an improvement in the quality of dental care will be supported by the <strong>Dentacoin\u2019s cloud-based Feedback System<\/strong> where patients can give their honest and valuable feedback to each dentist.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to that, <strong>an educational website<\/strong> that focuses on expanding patients\u2019 knowledge about dental care issues and <strong>an aftercare app<\/strong> that assists patients in steps to be followed post-treatment will be provided. Thus, patients will become more aware of how to properly take care of their dental health which will inevitably contribute to dentists\u2019 efforts to keep their patients\u2019 teeth in a flawless condition.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, <strong>the ETH blockchain will securely handle all patients\u2019 health records<\/strong>. Data will be highly protected, updatable and accessible only by patients. When permission is granted, dentists will be able to access and assess their patients\u2019 medical history records.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><strong>The distribution:\u00a0<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>The DCN distribution model is aimed at value creation for the dental industry worldwide. Each activity which generates value for the dental industry will be rewarded with Dentacoins (learn more). DCNs could be used to pay for unaffordable dental treatments. Due to the DCN being limited in amount and thus \u2013 inflation-protected, the value is expected to increase in time, giving the involved parties further benefits.<\/p>\n<p>To further increase its relevance as a store of value, <strong>each Dentacoin is legally bound to one share of the Dentacoin foundation and all its commodities.<\/strong> This truly revolutionary concept not only backs Dentacoins directly with real world assets but allows all coin holders to vote for important decisions regarding the foundation. In the long term, Dentacoin holders participate in the growing value of the global healthcare industry.<\/p>\n\t<hr>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>\n\t\t\tOriginally published at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/dentacoin-mission\/\">Dentacoin Blog<\/a>.\t\t<\/em>\n\t<\/p>\n\t","tags":[],"contentFormat":"html","canonicalUrl":"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/dentacoin-mission\/","license":"all-rights-reserved","publishStatus":"public","publishedAt":"2017-02-03T12:06:19+00:00","notifyFollowers":true}

Blockchains return the power back to the hands of the people by using cryptocurrency and tokens and provide maximum security for each individual.<br \/>\n<strong>Tokenization is converting rights to an asset into a crypto token on a blockchain.<\/strong> There is a great interest from banks, traders, start-ups and investors in linking real-world assets with blockchains. All advantages of blockchains can be utilized while saving the value and characteristics of the asset. Dentacoin Foundation developed a technically, legally and economically promising concept.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><strong>Why tokenize assets?<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><!--more Read more...--><\/p>\n<p>Shares, real estate, gold etc.: Some of these assets are difficult to physically transfer or subdivide. Buyers and sellers handle complex legal agreements, that are difficult to transfer and hard to track. Third parties must be involved and paid.<br \/>\nThe solution is to switch assets to a blockchain system and link them to assets in a secure legal way. Startups and major investors and banks around the world are now hurrying to develop block chain systems for <strong>the next step of this evolution: tokenizing assets<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><strong>But why would people want a digital token that<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>represents a share and how can that be done?<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Imagine Liz owns 1000 shares on a company. She wants to sell those shares directly to Michael. It is difficult to directly transfer shares to buyers because they require legal security and inspection through lawyers or banks to ensure that there are no fakes introduced.<br \/>\nMichael would like to invest a few thousand dollars in these shares but doesn\u2019t want to deal with banks and stock exchange. Michael would ideally like to own a small number of shares and wants to be able to freely handle those.<br \/>\nUnder the current circumstances, it would not even be worth it for Liz to find potential buyers like Michael and sell them a couple of shares; She wants an easy way to subdivide her shares and fractionally sell some shares to a variety of people.<br \/>\nMichael wants to be able to easily trade his fractional ownership to other people (rather than just with Liz). Both, Liz and Michael, would also like to exchange their shares at any time to a digital currency like Ether and from Ether to USD or Euro, at low cost and completely self-sufficient without the need of an authority. The ability to satisfy all involved parties in such a scenario is the promise of blockchain tokens (or coins) that represent real-world assets and democratize ownership of interesting asset classes.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><strong>Fascinating is that this token is also a currency<\/strong>.<\/h1>\n<p>A currency that is exchangeable at any time or can be used for payments or be held for speculative reasons. It generates the freedom to use everything of value as a medium of exchange.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The fact that a \"real world asset\" stands behind each token (Dentacoin, DCN) secures its value to this point where the actual value of the asset is reached.<\/strong> Due to the blockchain-induced, technically unchangeable maximum amount of DCNs and the compelling value-generating distribution of DCNs, an anti- inflation model is created. This deflationary mechanic drives an increase to the value after distributing more than 80% of the coins, at latest.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><strong>Dentacoin is a \"twenty-first-century derivative\",<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>freely and decentralized usable for everyone.\u00a0<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Many different ways of tokenizing assets are thinkable. The goal is to achieve the security, speed and ease-of-transfer of blockchain tokens for real-world assets. This is a new form of the old concept: \u201csecuritization\u201d (turning an asset into a security), and in this case, the tokenization of securitized assets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But Dentacoin offers much more:<\/strong> Besides being a value depot and a crypto-currency, DCN provides value-creating tools, which are based on the Ethereum blockchain-technology. Those tools will improve the dental industry, by providing various operational benefits, such as a health data base. Dentacoins major product is the game changing insurance model, though.

Why is he so convinced in the success of the Dentacoin concept? Learn below.<\/p>\n<h1>Prof. Dimitrakiev, in your statements and interviews you have explained the Dentacoin concept from different points of view. What is the central mission of Dentacoin?<\/h1>\n<p><strong>Prof. Dimitrakiev:<\/strong> It is an utter unfairness that only wealthy and middle class people have the privilege to afford state-of-the-art dental care. Nowadays, fixed teeth solutions with implants f.e. are the best treatment option for elderly people and a prerequisite for a normal, dignified life. But the reality is that the majority of people globally cannot afford these treatments. Thus, for budget reasons they have to settle with lower quality solutions, such as unreliable removable dentures.<\/p>\n<p>Here comes Dentacoin. Our team consists of dentists, insurance professionals, industry 4.0 experts, software developers, economists, marketing specialists who have already realized the need of change. We are developing a global industrial solution on the basis of the Ethereum Blockchain.<\/p>\n<h1>Why should a crypto-investor buy Dentacoins?<\/h1>\n<p><strong>Prof. Dimitrakiev:<\/strong> Dentacoin is a long-term concept aiming at improving the dental care quality worldwide and reducing the costs. This could not happen with one single action; it is a sequence of purposeful measures. Besides being backed with real-world assets and being used as an united cryptocurrency for the dental industry, DCN provides value-creating tools (a feedback system, a dental care app, an educational website), which are based on the Ethereum blockchain technology. Those tools, together with a game-changing insurance model, will inevitably improve the dental industry providing various benefits for suppliers, patients and dentists.

Why is he so convinced in the success of the Dentacoin concept? Learn below.<\/p>\n<h1>Prof. Dimitrakiev, in your statements and interviews you have explained the Dentacoin concept from different points of view. What is the central mission of Dentacoin?<\/h1>\n<p><strong>Prof. Dimitrakiev:<\/strong> It is an utter unfairness that only wealthy and middle class people have the privilege to afford state-of-the-art dental care. Nowadays, fixed teeth solutions with implants f.e. are the best treatment option for elderly people and a prerequisite for a normal, dignified life. But the reality is that the majority of people globally cannot afford these treatments. Thus, for budget reasons they have to settle with lower quality solutions, such as unreliable removable dentures.<\/p>\n<p>Here comes Dentacoin. <!--more-->Our team consists of dentists, insurance professionals, industry 4.0 experts, software developers, economists, marketing specialists who have already realized the need of change. We are developing a global industrial solution on the basis of the Ethereum Blockchain.<\/p>\n<h1>Why should a crypto-investor buy Dentacoins?<\/h1>\n<p><strong>Prof. Dimitrakiev:<\/strong> Dentacoin is a long-term concept aiming at improving the dental care quality worldwide and reducing the costs. This could not happen with one single action; it is a sequence of purposeful measures. Besides being backed with real-world assets and being used as an united cryptocurrency for the dental industry, DCN provides value-creating tools (a feedback system, a dental care app, an educational website), which are based on the Ethereum blockchain technology.

It was our pleasure to have Mr. Georgi Balinov, Director at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, sharing his thoughts on the hype around Blockchain Technology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dentacoin: Currently, there's hype around Blockchain technology. A recent report from the World Economic Forum predicts that by 2025 10% of GDP will be stored on Blockchains or Blockchain-related technology. This leads to the conclusion that Blockchain will have an impact on every industry. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of Blockchain solutions, specifically aligned with the needs of a particular industry. What do you think about the future of specific industrial solutions based on Blockchain?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Georgi Balinov:<\/strong> I think that there was a substantial amount of \"hype\" associated with Blockchain in 2015 and 2016 as it evolved away from its bitcoin roots to garner more mainstream attention. With that attention however a number of challenges also crystallized as industries looked to identify discrete use cases where blockchain can be implemented to solve very real problems or create efficiencies. I do believe that blockchain will be a core technology where current technology solutions have been insufficient. It will be fairly customized and likely on smaller scale than people originally expected, and likely in a more closed, controlled environment within very specific sectors of the economy with unsatisfied demand for seamless value transfer technology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dentacoin: Leading Macroeconomists describe the Blockchain technology as the \"Internet of Value\". We really like this term. How would you explain it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Georgi Balinov:<\/strong> Great question. Think about the internet, your ability to access it, globally, and exchange data based on common protocols. You can be anywhere in the world and send an email. The email will reach its recipient within seconds. It's seamless. That is how \"value\" ought to be exchanged as well. Quickly, frictionless, without loss along the way. Blockchain promises to get us a little closer to this utopia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dentacoin: It is being discussed that Blockchain has the potential to be the most transformative technology to hit the financial services sector since the Internet. It offers the function to record transactions and make them transparent, establish identity, establish safe contracts and providing safe payments. What do you think of this new role of the industrial Blockchain solutions?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Georgi Balinov:<\/strong> I believe the financial services industry is a prime candidate for commercial viability of blockchain technology. From capital markets to consumer payments, friction and cost need to be reduced. For example, settlement of securities that trade over the counter (not on exchanges), depending on asset class, can take weeks, involves manual processes and unnecessarily introduces risk into the financial system. On the consumer side, international money transfers running on the corresponding banking system are ripe for efficiency. By the time $100 goes from point A to point B around the world it is $90 at best, many days have passed and it may actually never get there. There are many other use cases with dozens of proofs of concept and real business models already in operation in the US. For the financial services industry, this is a game changer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dentacoin: It is natural that Blockchain will highly affect the effectiveness of the Healthcare Industry, as the largest industry by market capitalization. Blockchain will establish a direct connection between manufacturers and dentist, which will eliminate some of the intermediate players by using united industrial cryptocurrency, enabling fast, cost-effective and transparent transactions, and providing Blockchain healthcare systems.

What is your opinion on this?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Georgi Balinov:<\/strong> The healthcare industry is highly fragmented from a vendor, region and provider standpoint. There are surely numerous opportunities to apply blockchain technology and logic to streamlining healthcare operations and \"value\" exchange. In some respects it is not too dissimilar from the financial services industry in that regard. There are massive volumes of transactions that take place with countless participants and ultimate counterparties in various regions in different currencies. Blockchain can help alleviate some of this friction.

And while no one can say yet whether the role of the USD in the international monetary system will be the same dominant in future, there are more than just doubts.<\/p>\n<p>One key feature of the Bretton Woods system was that countries would bind their exchange rates to the US dollar. While this system was effectively eliminated in 1971, the US dollar\u2019s dominating role in the global currency system is still more or less intact \u2013 a reality that many people wouldn\u2019t like to accept.<\/p>\n<p>But such discontentment with the USD function as the dominant global reserve currency is not new. In the 60s, the French finance minister Valery Giscard d\u2019Estaing strongly criticized this \"privilege\u201d of the United States dollar\u2019s status in the currency system worldwide.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>The Belgian economist and scientist Robert Triffin analyzed that a global currency system based on a national currency could be risky and unstable, because of the different interests and the associated arbitrariness owing between USA\/USD and the rest of the world, caused by a US dollar-denominated system. The solution, however, lies not in replacing the dollar f.e. with the renminbi or the euro. The international currency SDR, introduced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has also failed.<\/p>\n<p>The star economist Thomas Piketti describes in his book \"The Capital in the 21st Century\" the pattern and the structure of the unequal capital distribution. Anyone who reads it carefully will also be able to recognize the mistakes coming from the current global currency system.<\/p>\n<p>In strengthening the role of the world\u2019s new and truly global currencies like Ether, Bitcoin, Dentacoin f.e. this may be the best solutions for the major unresolved currency problems in the world.<\/p>\n<p>While developed countries, including the US and the United Kingdom make profits with this old concept, losing low-income countries in the world and the imbalance grows.<\/p>\n<p>The simplest way to fulfill this vision would be to allocate a large group of krypto currencies as a full reserve asset, which countries could either use or deposit in their accounts. The IMF and the World Bank would use its own deposits to finance its lending operations, instead of having to rely on credits from members. To address developing countries high currency demands, a formula could be created to give them a larger share than they now receive in aquivalent to USD.

And while no one can say yet whether the role of the USD in the international monetary system will be the same dominant in future, there are more than just doubts.<\/p>\n<p>One key feature of the Bretton Woods system was that countries would bind their exchange rates to the US dollar. While this system was effectively eliminated in 1971, the US dollar\u2019s dominating role in the global currency system is still more or less intact \u2013 a reality that many people wouldn\u2019t like to accept.<\/p>\n<p>But such discontentment with the USD function as the dominant global reserve currency is not new. In the 60s, the French finance minister Valery Giscard d\u2019Estaing strongly criticized this \"privilege\u201d of the United States dollar\u2019s status in the currency system worldwide.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>The Belgian economist and scientist Robert Triffin analyzed that a global currency system based on a national currency could be risky and unstable, because of the different interests and the associated arbitrariness owing between USA\/USD and the rest of the world, caused by a US dollar-denominated system. The solution, however, lies not in replacing the dollar f.e. with the renminbi or the euro. The international currency SDR, introduced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has also failed.<\/p>\n<p>The star economist Thomas Piketti describes in his book \"The Capital in the 21st Century\" the pattern and the structure of the unequal capital distribution. Anyone who reads it carefully will also be able to recognize the mistakes coming from the current global currency system.<\/p>\n<p>In strengthening the role of the world\u2019s new and truly global currencies like Ether, Bitcoin, Dentacoin f.e. this may be the best solutions for the major unresolved currency problems in the world.<\/p>\n<p>While developed countries, including the US and the United Kingdom make profits with this old concept, losing low-income countries in the world and the imbalance grows.<\/p>\n<p>The simplest way to fulfill this vision would be to allocate a large group of krypto currencies as a full reserve asset, which countries could either use or deposit in their accounts. The IMF and the World Bank would use its own deposits to finance its lending operations, instead of having to rely on credits from members. To address developing countries high currency demands, a formula could be created to give them a larger share than they now receive in aquivalent to USD. In the same time the privat use of crypto currencies could also be encouraged and private users will prefer to use this new currencies about the easy and cheap way to use.<\/p>\n<p>Since large numbers of different cryptocurrencies can exist economically as tokens within the blockchain at the same time, and these currencies are not tied to individual countries, they offer a much more stable basis.

About 90% of our patients are from Western Europe (mainly Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the United Kingdom) and the other 10% are Russian and Bulgarian. As I mentioned, I believe it was relatively easy to explain the concept to each patient as we presented the information differently to different people so that they could comprehend it. In the first month we started opening wallets to 30% of all the patients (60 patients per week on average) and then we gradually increased the number. Currently (19. May 2017), 308 of our patients have their wallets.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we have an undoubted interest in using Dentacoins at our dental clinic, we have estimated that we can sign an average of 60 new contracts each week, which is the equivalent of new Dentacoin Wallets being created each week. On an annual basis that means around 3000 new Dentacoin Wallet for the 49 working weeks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: How many of them reported a positive experience?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: All patients were very satisfied with the chance to give us their feedback on our service and treatment quality. The fact that they participate in the program with a new currency, especially designed for Dentistry, made the experience very exciting. Dentacoin really is a custom-made token for the Dental Industry and feels like a privilege to be used by both industry and patients.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: It was very easy for your clinic to adopt our model for rewarding patients with Dentacoin for their feedback. This so-called Feedback System which you implemented into your Patient Loyalty Program was actually the intersection between Dentacoin\u2019s and Swiss Dentaprime\u2019s concepts. Please, describe your experience with the system and the benefits out of it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: We strongly believe that the patient comes first, so all our services are aligned with patients\u2019 needs and feedback. Throughout the years we have used different methods to encourage our customers to give really honest feedback, which will then help us improve aspects we needed to improve. The Feedback System of Dentacoin offers just that. Our daily workflow is very specific so we were even happier when we could adjust the sections of the Feedback System to match the exact steps of the patient at our clinic. We made it detailed, with descriptions and even pictures of our specialists, in order to bring better user experience to our patients. They just love this. Every patient describes each step of their visit to our clinic, and we know which doctor feels better to them, and which process needs to be worked on, so that the visit of the patient at our clinic becomes the most exciting experience of their life. So the patient gets heard, and upon his next visit, he can already see we implemented some changes in our flow to better match their expectations and preferences. And on top of that, they get paid with Dentacoin, which they use as means of payment upon their next visit to our clinic. And on our side \u2013 we get honest feedback from each patient and we know where we need to work in order to improve. This is a never-ending process, and we know how valuable this feedback is. As an addition, we get some great ideas from our patients. We are currently working on some educational videos, which will help patients to better understand the processes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: You worked on adapting the Feedback System to match the processes at your clinic, thus each doctor and each assistant gets graded for each time they meet a patient. How is this Feedback affecting them?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: The team gets the feedback immediately after it is sent by the patient, which is a great opportunity for them to work on themselves while they still have detailed reflection of the events. This is something, which motivates them to become better with direct feedback from the patient experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: How many of the patients already used the Dentacoins they earned at your clinic?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Our treatment specifics require the patients to visit us twice in most of the cases. So we decided it would be best if patients can use their Dentacoins during their second visit to our clinic. Due to the short duration of this reported period, we have about 15% of our Patients coming back for a second visit and almost all of them already spent their Dentacoins. One of the patients is really interested in the currency development, though, so he decided to store it in his wallet. Now they are asking for additional ways to earn more Dentacoins, which then they can give to their family or friends who are about to visit us soon. We also had many patients asking if they can spend the Dentacoins they earned at our clinic at other clinics around the world. This really is a cryptocurrency created for the Global Dental Industry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Did you notice any additional benefits to your clinic?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Actually yes! As mentioned, most of the patients who came for a second visit and already spent their Dentacoins are asking for alternative ways to earn more. So we have already thought about enlarging our Patient Loyalty Program with referral options. For each patient, who refers a new patient to our clinic, we will give Dentacoins. This helps our marketing efforts and we have already discussed that this option can be developed even further to become more effective way for attracting new patients and eventually reduce some marketing costs. Also, we are preparing a catalogue with dental care products which could be bought with Dentacoin.<\/p>\n<p>The options with Dentacoin are really countless.

Therefore, it had to be a clinic with affinity to innovations and willingness for a constant improvement. The first clinic to ever identify with our concept for the global dental industry was SWISS Dentaprime \u2013 an innovative Dental Implant Clinic, which strongly invests in digitization and automation in all aspects of their work.<\/p>\n<p>In March 2017 they implemented Dentacoin as means of payment and as a part of a Patient Loyalty Program (rewarding patients for giving constant feedback, writing reviews, recommending the clinic to other people).

Token economy is also every workplace; each person who goes to work gets rewarded upon achieving goals, set by the business, and in return gets paid.

If they don\u2019t, they won\u2019t.<\/i>\u201d- Paul Greenberg, Managing Principal of The 56 Group, a customer strategy company, and Author of \"CRM at the Speed of Light\".<\/p>\n<p>Among thousands of definitions of \u201ccustomer experience\u201d (CX), I couldn\u2019t find a simpler and better one. In today\u2019s highly-competitive and turbulent business environment, customer experience controls whether a product, a service, a company or a whole industry is successful or not. Dental Industry is no exception. But before we talk about how Dentacoin could help global dental industry to implement a patient-driven strategy, let\u2019s have a closer look to the ubiquitous importance of customer experience.<!--more--><\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><b>Why is customer experience so important?<\/b><\/h1>\n<p>According to the <i>Huffington Post<\/i>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/vala-afshar\/50-important-customer-exp_b_8295772.html\"><u>70 percent of companies that deliver outstanding customer experience rely on customer feedback <\/u><\/a>. Smart companies have already realized the essential importance of bringing customer intelligence into all business processes. Thus, new-age organizations don\u2019t just passively wait for a random customer to write a review on Facebook or to imperceptibly drop a face-to-face comment, so that they could get an idea about the perceived CX. Instead, they proactively invite customers to be a part of the development process by asking for feedback, recommendations, ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, a co-creation process is formed, where companies and customers work together to create and optimize products, services, certain activities and processes. Customers are not only invited to the business stage; they get the leading role in the show.<\/p>\n<p>This paradigm shift requires an infrastructure, which enables customers to freely and regularly give their feedback and thus helps companies to optimize the overall customer journey in accordance to customers' needs. <strong>The old \u201cGive-them-what-you-have-and-teach-them-to-like-it\u201d approach doesn\u2019t seem to work anymore.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><b>Who has the control over customer experience?<\/b><\/h1>\n<p>Here comes the tricky part. Customers nowadays are more informed and more empowered than ever before, and on the top of that \u2013 overloaded with choices. Among these choices, there are products\/services\/companies\/industries they trust and others - they don\u2019t. Choice is often determined by trust, both closely related to customer experience (own CX and others').<\/p>\n<p>But is customer experience something that could be controlled or owned by companies? Most certainly not. <strong>Customer experience is only owned by the customer.<\/strong> What every company does need however, as mentioned above, is to deliver an infrastructure where customers have the freedom to raise their voice and companies have the possibility to easily implement customers\u2019 wisdom into the workflow. This self-learning infrastructure should be designed for continuous improvement based on measured customer feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Moving to a customer-driven strategy will then lead to a positive word-of-mouth effect \u2013 the most trusted source of information for customers worldwide.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><b>Is this customer-driven approach ubiquitously applicable?<\/b><\/h1>\n<p>Some will argue that depending on the industry, business regulations, government rules, compliance, it might not always be possible to apply this level of customer-driven strategy. I would call this statement into doubt.<\/p>\n<p><strong>No matter how strong is the institutional control over a certain industry, nobody can control the customer experience and its tremendous impact on the industry.<\/strong> No regulatory authority, no central institution, no powerful organization or individual could control the industry better and stronger than the customer community. However pleasant the opposite idea might be, it seems more like an Utopian one.<\/p>\n<p>Healthcare Industry e.g. is a highly regulated industry for understandable reasons. The role of regulatory bodies in ensuring that certain standards are maintained is undoubted and of the utmost importance. However, as a patient you wouldn\u2019t trust a dental practice only because it is approved by the Government, would you? But you would consider trusting it because a friend of yours has been there. And you would consider trusting the thousands positive reviews about it. You would consider trusting the patient community.<\/p>\n<p>People... It's always about people trusting other people.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><b>So, how does Dentacoin fit in this new-age business reality?<\/b><\/h1>\n<p>There is nothing more valuable to dentists than constant, trustworthy feedback from the patient community. But what if this community doesn\u2019t exist yet? What if patients have no tribune to speak their minds and therefore \u2013 to contribute to the overall quality improvement of the industry? This is where Dentacoin steps in.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Through creating and implementing the first Blockchain-based platform for trusted dental treatment reviews, Dentacoin will allow patients to raise their voice.<\/strong> Simultaneously, dentists will have access to up-to-date, extremely valuable market research data and qualified patient feedback - the most powerful tool to improve service quality and to establish a loyal patient base. Through a self-executing Smart Contract, the Dentacoin review platform will assure optimal autonomy, trust, speed and safety.<\/p>\n<p>Dentacoin\u2019s one-of- a-kind feedback platform will be supported by various other value-creating solutions: a dental insurance model, a healthcare database, an aftercare mobile app, an educational website. All devoted to the same purpose - to improve dental care quality worldwide by giving the power to the hands of the people.<\/p>\n<p>Through Dentacoin, patients will become the drivers, the influencers, the decision makers, when it comes to their own health. After all, it is the patient experience that matters. It is the patient experience that should set the direction.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1>You want to know more about Dentacoin?

Economic success always steps on numbers. Faith is needed, but it could be a very unstable basis. Long-term success requires calculating, deep market understanding, planning, analyzing, rational thinking, controlling, constant optimizing. Otherwise, big ideas would never make it to successfully implemented concepts. They would easily be forgotten after the collected funds are used with no significant success. Thus, a lot of money would be burnt, comparably to the \"new markets\" creation in the USA and Europe in the late 1990s.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1>What about Blockchain-based industrial solutions?<\/h1>\n<p>While Ethereum has a real chance to be the leading Blockchain platform also in future, Blockchain-based B2C industrial solutions will be the real winners on the market.<\/p>\n<p>Dentacoin, for instance, is a custom token for the global dental industry. Apart from being designed as an industrial means of payment, Dentacoin is developing numerous tools with a common purpose: to create a community between patients and dentists and thus \u2013 to improve the overall treatment quality worldwide. Simultaneously, dentists will achieve significant economic success, as they will have a loyal patient base to help them improve the quality of service and treatment provided. Additionally, costs of all market participants will be reduced.<\/p>\n<p>These results are supported by the real-world experiences of our first partner clinics (see their report here). Currently all previous expectations are met.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWin-win\u201d models are changing the world for the better\u2026<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1>To the point: What would be the future value of Dentacoin (DCN)?<\/h1>\n<p>The calculation of the future value is based on the number of Dentacoin wallets created. In the first 3 stages of its development, Dentacoin Foundation aims at achieving a market share of 1%. In the global dental industry, this 1% market share means 600 million patients and 200 000 dentists, using the Dentacoin value-creating tools. Within 1% market share and with a conservative rate of USD 60 per patient and USD 600 per dentist, a company value of approximately USD 4 billion is generated. USD 4 billion per 1% market share.<\/p>\n<p>With a market share of 20%, achievable in the long term, a market value of USD 80 billion would be generated.<\/p>\n<p>After applying the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, the current value of DCN is calculated to USD 0.07, or 7 USD cents. At the current market price of Ether (1 ETH = 200 USD, as per 31.05.2017), that means an exchange value against Ether of about 2000 DCN\/ETH.<\/p>\n<p>However, Dentacoin Foundation has initially defined a significantly lower valuation, as the current market value of Ether is considered to be exaggerated and thus \u2013 not reliable enough. During the Dentacoin first ICO on 1st of October 2017, the DCN value will be initially set to 8000 DCN\/ ETH.<\/p>\n<p>The further value development of DCN will be disassociated from ETH. We strongly believe that after the ICO, Dentacoin have objective chances to increase in value even stronger than Ether (further analysis on the topic is coming soon).<\/p>\n\t<hr>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>\n\t\t\tOriginally published at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/what-would-be-the-future-value-of-dentacoin-dcn\/\">Dentacoin Blog<\/a>.\t\t<\/em>\n\t<\/p>\n\t","tags":["blockchain","business model","dentacoin","dental industry","ethereum","market value"],"contentFormat":"html","canonicalUrl":"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/what-would-be-the-future-value-of-dentacoin-dcn\/","license":"all-rights-reserved","publishStatus":"public","publishedAt":"2017-05-31T11:01:41+00:00","notifyFollowers":true}

However, in order to offer investors better chance to participate, the Dentacoin Foundation has initially defined a significantly lower value of DCN. The future performance of DCN is estimated by consultants of Dentacoin Foundation as following [1].<\/p>\n<p>- DCF value\u00a0(May 2017): 2000 DCN\/ETH (rough calculation).<\/p>\n<p>- Value during the Presale (1. July 2017): 12000 DCN\/ETH.<\/p>\n<p>- First Token Sale (1. October 2017): from 8000 DCN\/ETH to 6000 DCN\/ETH.<\/p>\n<p>- Target Price (December 2017): 2 USD cent\/DCN.<\/p>\n<p>- Target Price (July 2018): 10 USD cent\/DCN.<\/p>\n<p>- Long-term Target Price: 1 USD\/DCN.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody can say for certain how the exchange rate of DCN will develop in future. That would be prophecy. When the market takes control, everything is possible. Before making any investment, everyone should examine the business model in details and also - consult experts, if needed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Whether the price target of DCN is reached or not, depends on three main factors:<\/strong><br \/>\n1. Speed and quality of development in accordance to the plan.<br \/>\n2. Market factors.<br \/>\n3. Emotional condition of market participants.<\/p>\n<p>All three factors could not be predicted by anyone. The only thing, known with certainty, is that the 120-member team of Dentacoin Foundation is doing its best to achieve the goals planned.

Here are 8 reasons why:<!--more--><\/p>\n<h1>1. Volume<\/h1>\n<p>The minimum required volume of a FIAT currency in order to have a chance for a global use is 5% of the total FIAT currencies volume.

To summarize: the total volume of Dentacoins produced covers the minimum requirement for a currency to be recognized as global.<\/p>\n<h1>2. Distribution costs<\/h1>\n<p>Free distribution is the next condition for a currency to cover in order to be globally used. The distribution model of Dentacoin does not imply mining, thus no energy consumption is required.<\/p>\n<h1>3. Real-world assets backed<\/h1>\n<p>To further increase its relevance as a store of value, each Dentacoin is legally bound to one share of the Dentacoin foundation and all its growing material and immaterial assets. That backs each Dentacoin with real-world value, which inevitably creates trust \u2013 another requirement for a currency to be internationally used.<\/p>\n<h1>4. Democratic currency<\/h1>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/tokenization-of-real-world-assets-by-dentacoin\/\">The revolutionary tokenization concept not only backs Dentacoins directly with real-world assets<\/a> but allows all coin holders to vote for all important decisions regarding the foundation\u2019s articles of incorporation (1 DCN = 1 vote). This model is an epitome of a democratic currency, independent from any influences from managers, banks, states, central institutions.<\/p>\n<h1>5. Distribution model<\/h1>\n<p>Dentacoin\u2019s distribution is anti-inflationary due to the fact that the distribution happens only through:<br \/>\na) Token Sales - the collected funds increase the value of the Dentacoin foundation, which every coin holder participates in;<br \/>\nb) Work \u2013 each individual could earn Dentacoin through value-generating activities (meaning each activity which helps to improve dental care quality worldwide \u2013 giving feedback, writing articles, etc.). This coin distribution model is known as a value-generating distribution.<\/p>\n<h1>6. Pricing and future value<\/h1>\n<p>As everyone could buy DCN, there is an extremely low market entry, which implies a strong potential for increase in value. The initial value of Dentacoin in the Exclusive Presale (starting July 1st, 2017) is 0.003521 USD cent\/DCN. The medium-term price target is 1 USD\/DCN, meaning that when this price target is reached, the first DCN sold will have multiplied their value with the factor of 28 400.

Having observed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/report-implementation-of-dentacoin-as-a-currency-in-first-partner-clinic\/\">the first experiences of SWISS Dentaprime<\/a>* with Dentacoin, the innovative dental clinic expressed interest in using Dentacoin as means of payment and within their Patient Rewards Program. From 10th of July 2017 on each patient, who gives feedback, and thus helps the clinic to improve their service quality, is entitled to a reward paid entirely in Dentacoins. Another way to earn Dentacoins at F3T London is by having a video interview, or posting an online review, which will help other patients when making a decision whether or not to use the services of the clinic. Later, patients could pay part of their treatment invoice with Dentacoin.<\/p>\n<p>As a pilot project for this entirely new concept of dental clinics, patient feedback is essential for the future success of the venture. Therefore, Dentacoin plays an essential part in the future growth of the business.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1>Next step: Dentacoin Trusted Review Platform<\/h1>\n<p>F3T Dental Clinic also plans on being one of the first users of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/trusted-review-platform\/\">the Dentacoin Trusted Review Platform<\/a>. The automated, manipulation-protected transactions on the platform will help the clinic to operate easier with Dentacoin while simultaneously achieving positive impact on its online presence, as well as developing stronger bond with the patients.<\/p>\n<p>As the minimal Presale request has been passed less than 24 hours after the Presale start, the Dentacoin Team proceeds with developing this first value-generating tool for global use. The Trusted Review is the first Blockchain-based platform for trusted dental treatment reviews which allows patients to raise their voice and thus - to have a strong influence on the overall treatment quality in the industry. Simultaneously, it offers dentists access to up-to-date, extremely valuable market research data and qualified patient feedback - the most powerful tool to improve service quality and to establish a loyal patient base.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1>What makes the Dentacoin Trusted Review platform different?<\/h1>\n<p><strong>\u2713 No censorship.<\/strong> Due to the transparent, incentive-based and censorship resistant nature of this Blockchain-based solution, Dentacoin Review Platform aims at being the most functional review and market research system. Through a self-executing Ethereum Smart Contract, the Dentacoin review platform assures optimal autonomy, trust, speed and safety.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2713 Rewarded feedback.<\/strong> Patients are able to find their dentists in order to write a review based on open and multiple-choice questions and optionally \u2013 answer market research questions. Each survey is linked to the Ethereum blockchain and paid for in Dentacoins by a Smart Contract. In return, the earned amount can be used to pay for part of the further treatments at one of the Dentacoin partner dentists\/clinics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2713 Trusted Reviews.<\/strong> In order to provide even more trustworthy customer reviews, a new notion of \u201etrusted reviews\u201c is implemented. Thus, there is a difference between standard reviews (which generally may be written by anyone) and trusted reviews on the other hand, which can only be written by actual patients. To make sure that a reviewer writes the feedback based on a prior treatment, each partner dentist is able to invite patients via email containing a review request link. This review is then marked as a trusted review.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2713 Global Community.<\/strong> By providing ways of earning and spending Dentacoins, we distribute the dental currency all over the industry. And even better: we harvest profound knowledge of the industry, allowing dentists and patients to form strong communities around the world and build upon mutual interest.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Excited? Same here.<br \/>\nWhat else would you like to know about the first experiences of our partner clinics? Or about the first Dentacoin tools to be developed? Get in touch and you will learn just as much as you would like to.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>* SWISS Dentaprime (Varna, Bulgaria) and Dentaprime F3T (London, United Kingdom) are two independent legal entities.

Having observed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/report-implementation-of-dentacoin-as-a-currency-in-first-partner-clinic\/\">the first experiences of SWISS Dentaprime<\/a>* with Dentacoin, the innovative dental clinic expressed interest in using Dentacoin as means of payment and within their Patient Rewards Program. From 10th of July 2017 on each patient, who gives feedback, and thus helps the clinic to improve their service quality, is entitled to a reward paid entirely in Dentacoins. Another way to earn Dentacoins at F3T London is by having a video interview, or posting an online review, which will help other patients when making a decision whether or not to use the services of the clinic. Later, patients could pay part of their treatment invoice with Dentacoin.<\/p>\n<p>As a pilot project for this entirely new concept of dental clinics, patient feedback is essential for the future success of the venture. Therefore, Dentacoin plays an essential part in the future growth of the business.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1>Next step: Dentacoin Trusted Review Platform<\/h1>\n<p>F3T Dental Clinic also plans on being one of the first users of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/trusted-review-platform\/\">the Dentacoin Trusted Review Platform<\/a>. The automated, manipulation-protected transactions on the platform will help the clinic to operate easier with Dentacoin while simultaneously achieving positive impact on its online presence, as well as developing stronger bond with the patients.<\/p>\n<p>As the minimal Presale request has been passed less than 24 hours after the Presale start, the Dentacoin Team proceeds with developing this first value-generating tool for global use. The Trusted Review is the first Blockchain-based platform for trusted dental treatment reviews which allows patients to raise their voice and thus - to have a strong influence on the overall treatment quality in the industry. Simultaneously, it offers dentists access to up-to-date, extremely valuable market research data and qualified patient feedback - the most powerful tool to improve service quality and to establish a loyal patient base.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1>What makes the Dentacoin Trusted Review platform different?<\/h1>\n<p><strong>\u2713 No censorship.<\/strong> Due to the transparent, incentive-based and censorship resistant nature of this Blockchain-based solution, Dentacoin Review Platform aims at being the most functional review and market research system. Through a self-executing Ethereum Smart Contract, the Dentacoin review platform assures optimal autonomy, trust, speed and safety.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2713 Rewarded feedback.<\/strong> Patients are able to find their dentists in order to write a review based on open and multiple-choice questions and optionally \u2013 answer market research questions. Each survey is linked to the Ethereum blockchain and paid for in Dentacoins by a Smart Contract. In return, the earned amount can be used to pay for part of the further treatments at one of the Dentacoin partner dentists\/clinics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2713 Trusted Reviews.<\/strong> In order to provide even more trustworthy customer reviews, a new notion of \u201etrusted reviews\u201c is implemented. Thus, there is a difference between standard reviews (which generally may be written by anyone) and trusted reviews on the other hand, which can only be written by actual patients. To make sure that a reviewer writes the feedback based on a prior treatment, each partner dentist is able to invite patients via email containing a review request link. This review is then marked as a trusted review.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2713 Global Community.<\/strong> By providing ways of earning and spending Dentacoins, we distribute the dental currency all over the industry. And even better: we harvest profound knowledge of the industry, allowing dentists and patients to form strong communities around the world and build upon mutual interest.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Excited? Same here.<br \/>\nWhat else would you like to know about the first experiences of our partner clinics? Or about the first Dentacoin tools to be developed? Get in touch and you will learn just as much as you would like to.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>* SWISS Dentaprime (Varna, Bulgaria) and Dentaprime F3T (London, United Kingdom) are two independent legal entities. The start-up clinic in London had the opportunity to use the brand \u201cDentaprime\u201d in its name, as their dental practitioners are trained and certified by the Dentaprime Academy.<\/p>\n\t<hr>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>\n\t\t\tOriginally published at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/second-clinic-in-london-implemented-dentacoin\/\">Dentacoin Blog<\/a>.\t\t<\/em>\n\t<\/p>\n\t","tags":["altcoins","bitcoin","cryptocurrency","dentacoin","dentistry","ethereum"],"contentFormat":"html","canonicalUrl":"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/second-clinic-in-london-implemented-dentacoin\/","license":"all-rights-reserved","publishStatus":"public","publishedAt":"2017-07-10T19:05:58+00:00","notifyFollowers":true}

While still in a Presale period (with over 1600 contributors already on board, as per 13\/07\/2017), Dentacoin has already been implemented in two partner clinics in Europe.

Potential future partners from the United States, Brazil, South Africa, Netherlands, Germany, Australia and other countries are eager to implement the first Dentacoin tools and have already signed up for testing the Trusted Review Platform at their dental practices.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, we invited the team of our first partner clinic \u2013 SWISS Dentaprime \u2013 to explain us how they have integrated Dentacoin in their CRM platform Salesforce* in order to track the Dentacoin transactions within the patient flow. We talked to Ms. Emine Yumerova, Salesforce Administrator at SWISS Dentaprime clinic.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<p><strong>Dentacoin: Ms. Yumerova, could you please tell us first what is the role of Salesforce in your organization?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ms. Yumerova:<\/strong> Working with more than 3000 patients per year requires a CRM system which allows every single member of our team to keep track of all customer communications at any given moment. Quite naturally, our needs to constantly generate and nurture thousands of leads, to convert them to patients, to create and optimize 1-to-1 customer experiences and to constantly carry out detailed analyzes of the customer journey led us to the leader among the CRM platforms: Salesforce. Basically, Salesforce connects our entire business on one platform. The complete view enables customer support agents to be more proactive and productive, while providing the personalized experience that customers want. That leads to high productiveness and efficiency, increased patient satisfaction and recommendation quote, cost savings and revenue gains.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<p><strong>Dentacoin: It is understandable why you needed to integrate Dentacoin in Salesforce \u2013 it is now an essential part of the patient communications history and it is related to the payments as well.

Having been informed from our Support team about the possibility to earn Dentacoins through so called \u201cvalue-generating\u201d activities, patients arrive at the clinic with a lot of different questions about the DCN rewards. I cannot deny that a fraction of the patients are not interested in the essence of Dentacoin as a crypto token due to their low tech knowledge. But it is undeniable that most of the patients are highly interested in the benefits, i.e. the possibility to use Dentacoin for paying part of their treatment.<\/p>\n<p>Let's follow the complete process in Salesforce. First, inside each patient Account in Salesforce, there is general information such as what is the patient\u2019s wallet address, who has recommended the clinic to the patient, what is his Dentacoin balance (meaning the difference between the received and the spent DCN in SWISS\u00a0Dentaprime), what is his DCN wallet balance in general (it might differ from the one in the \u201cDentacoin Balance\u201d field if for example the patient has bought Dentacoins additionally) and when for the last time someone from the Support team has checked the balance.<\/p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_499\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/general-info.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-499\" src=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/general-info-1024x374.png\" alt=\"General info - Dentacoin in Salesforce, Swiss Dentaprime\" width=\"1024\" height=\"374\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Click to zoom<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>The verification of the wallet balance happens directly in Etherscan.

This is great way to test the waters and also spread awareness on Dentacoin on the right places.<\/p>\n<p>As most of you early supporters know, we are approaching our first official ICO, which is planned for October 1<sup>st<\/sup>, 2017.\u00a0 We are negotiating conditions with exchange platforms, which will offer Dentacoin trading against other crypto currencies, as well as fiat currencies, such as Euros and Dollars.<\/p>\n<p><em>At the moment we are working on the development of our first 3 tools, which will be launched in September. This means, that millions of people will have access to Dentacoin. Millions of Dentacoin holders means millions of investors, which will look for ways to trade their Dentacoins. <\/em><\/p>\n\t<hr>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>\n\t\t\tOriginally published at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/dentacoin-is-now-traded-on-cryptopia\/\">Dentacoin Blog<\/a>.\t\t<\/em>\n\t<\/p>\n\t","tags":["cryptocurrency","dentacoin","exchange platforms"],"contentFormat":"html","canonicalUrl":"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/dentacoin-is-now-traded-on-cryptopia\/","license":"all-rights-reserved","publishStatus":"public","publishedAt":"2017-08-08T11:05:21+00:00","notifyFollowers":true}

These tokens are redeemable in cryptocurrency, and the Blockchain system is gaining pull through renowned financial authorities as a means to reduce costs and enable a more efficient monetary process. <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@heckerhut\/a-blockchain-token-taxonomy-fadf5c56139a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>The <\/strong><strong>rise of ICOs<\/strong><\/a> has led to greater interest among investors for blockchain start-ups. ICOs present a win-win situation for investors, as it offers ease of access to liquidity through exchanges of between members of the community. ICOs present investors with extremely large returns in short time periods.\u00a0 In terms of minimal regulation, ICOs drive massive investment, as the government issues little-known rulings on ICOs. This rule has prompted sustainable valuations for ICOs and entrepreneurs can also set their limits, when investing. ICOs are one of the easiest and most efficient methods for companies and individuals to fund their projects and for regular users to invest in projects they see the value. An Initial Coin Offering is an event that usually extends over a period of one week or more and in which everyone is allowed to purchase newly issued tokens in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH).<\/p>\n<h4><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>Dentacoin Token Sale<\/h4>\n<p>In the example of Dentacoin, we had an Exclusive Presale, which took place during July 2017. It was an exclusive event, which offered our tokens at a very cheap, extremely attractive price for early supporters of our mission. These supporters are so important to us, that we decided to offer 8 million Dentacoins for each Ether invested into our Presale. This event has contributed 2022 Ethers to Dentacoin mission, which supported the development of our projects, according to the Roadmap. Thus, just a month later we have already launched our <a href=\"https:\/\/reviews.dentacoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Decentralized Trusted Reviews Platform<\/a>, which is already operating with registered users. All Dentacoins, which registered users earn, together with the distributed tokens on our first bounty program and our exclusive token sale, are forming the circulating supply of Dentacoin. There are already 3 Exchange Platforms, which trade Dentacoin, meaning that Dentacoin already has a <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/assets\/dentacoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market price<\/a>. Each platform is a separate market, therefore the price of Dentacoin on each of these 3 platforms is different. This is not just the case of Dentacoin, but also with all cryptocurrencies, which are on the market.<\/p>\n<p>In an ICO, there can be a specific goal or limit for project funding, meaning that every token will have a pre-designated price that will not change during the Initial Coin Offering period, which also means that the token supply is static. It is also possible to have a static supply with a dynamic funding goal, in which the distribution of tokens will be made according to the funds received; meaning that the more money the project receives, the higher the token price will be.<\/p>\n<p>ICOs enthusiasts currently worry over the recent intervention by <strong>Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)<\/strong> over a purported regulation of the digital coins that the coins should be put up as securities. SEC concludes that digital coins issued by the startup should serve the same purpose as traditional shares. This poses a central problem, to sell ICOs as published by the traditional corporations but ICOs remain popular.\u00a0 Despite what seems like a legal burden, ICOs are unlikely to lose investments and according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/michaeldurkheimer\/2017\/08\/15\/despite-sec-regulation-icos-are-unlikely-to-lose-their-investors\/#180ea87f7475\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forbes\u00a0stats<\/a>- \u201cThe value of Bitcoin has increased over 400% in January 2017, and the market value is about $70 billion, with about 16.5 million Bitcoins in circulation.\u00a0 Etherum has also had a more dramatic rise, with over 3,500% increase in value and almost $27 billion in new wealth for the coin holders\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>ICO is designed to secure funds for an early-stage company, issuing a token, cryptocurrency, and selling its supply to an audience as a tradable asset with much potential for growth. In 2016, Golem, Iconomi, and Waves platform made $103 million in 64 campaigns. The CEO of Waves Platform Alexander Ivanov Quotes that- <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/ico-market-from-6000-to-150-mln-overview-with-waves-ceo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Demand for ICOs is real and people are turning to it as an alternative to access funds for start-ups. The project is fast, granting funds where Venture Capitalists and bank loans can\u2019t be obtained<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4><strong><br \/>\nDefining Market Price<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Economists say the current price of an asset or service is the market price. It is also described as being determined by the forces of demand and supply- a result of interactions between investors, traders, and dealers. Market price is determined by quotes from dealers who represent buyers, using a bid and asking price. The dealer buys at his deal price and sells at the asking price of the market. The price derivation formula depends on some bids available to the offers by sellers \u2013 if external forces demand more volume, dealers will make the stocks available at the offer. This adjusts the market price either negatively or positively. Thus prices are not fixed without interactions from both directions.<\/p>\n<p>Shares are being traded on the exchange even after <a href=\"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/i\/ipo.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Initial Public Offering (IPO)<\/strong><\/a> because of the perceived value of company changes over time. Investors can make or lose money depending on whether their perceptions are in agreement with \"the market\u201d. Investors monitor moment-to-moment fluctuations in stock prices, to check how well the stocks are faring. The ultimate goal of buying shares is to make money by buying stocks in companies you expect to do well, those whose perceived value (in the form of the stock price) will rise. When you buy shares of a company, you own a piece of that business and therefore have a vote in how it is run. Investors don\u2019t all have the same agenda in the exchange, and a stock can\u2019t be sold when there is no buyer, this sometimes causes aggression as dealers look for buyers. Prices also remain low until wealthy buyers step in.<\/p>\n<p>Market Price in its IPO also has its risks \u2013 analysts have found it difficult to interpret how well stocks will fare on the initial day and the future because there are shareholders who could seemingly pull out of the company. IPOs are also for enterprises going through the growth period, with much uncertainty about their future.<\/p>\n<h4><strong><br \/>\nBottom line <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Investors do not use fiat money to buy ICOs. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are employed to purchase in the blockchain. Stocks are traded when a company needs money or when a seller, perceives a better investment elsewhere which sometimes puts the capital market in shock. The market price and ICOs are independent of each other, but ICOs offer alternatives as a way to diversify wealth because the human forces determine the stock exchange.<\/p>\n<p>However, with the decentralized platform of ICOs, it gives the community protections, and its blockchain design allows people to issue their tokens without restrictions and collectively vote for the viability of the project.<br \/>\n<strong>Next <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/ico\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">token sale of Dentacoin is planned for October 2017<\/a>, when 1 USD Cent will buy 85.3 Dentacoins.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n","tags":["dentacoin","exchange platforms","ico","ipo","market price","reviews","token sale"],"contentFormat":"html","canonicalUrl":"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/how-ico-price-and-market-price-are-different-and-why-one-doesnt-depend-on-the-other\/","license":null,"publishStatus":null,"publishedAt":"2017-08-21T09:39:03+00:00","notifyFollowers":false}

These tokens are redeemable in cryptocurrency, and the Blockchain system is gaining pull through renowned financial authorities as a means to reduce costs and enable a more efficient monetary process. <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@heckerhut\/a-blockchain-token-taxonomy-fadf5c56139a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>The <\/strong><strong>rise of ICOs<\/strong><\/a> has led to greater interest among investors for blockchain start-ups. ICOs present a win-win situation for investors, as it offers ease of access to liquidity through exchanges of between members of the community. ICOs present investors with extremely large returns in short time periods.\u00a0 In terms of minimal regulation, ICOs drive massive investment, as the government issues little-known rulings on ICOs. This rule has prompted sustainable valuations for ICOs and entrepreneurs can also set their limits, when investing. ICOs are one of the easiest and most efficient methods for companies and individuals to fund their projects and for regular users to invest in projects they see the value. An Initial Coin Offering is an event that usually extends over a period of one week or more and in which everyone is allowed to purchase newly issued tokens in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH).<\/p>\n<h4><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>Dentacoin Token Sale<\/h4>\n<p>In the example of Dentacoin, we had an Exclusive Presale, which took place during July 2017. It was an exclusive event, which offered our tokens at a very cheap, extremely attractive price for early supporters of our mission. These supporters are so important to us, that we decided to offer 8 million Dentacoins for each Ether invested into our Presale. This event has contributed 2022 Ethers to Dentacoin mission, which supported the development of our projects, according to the Roadmap. Thus, just a month later we have already launched our <a href=\"https:\/\/reviews.dentacoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Decentralized Trusted Reviews Platform<\/a>, which is already operating with registered users. All Dentacoins, which registered users earn, together with the distributed tokens on our first bounty program and our exclusive token sale, are forming the circulating supply of Dentacoin. There are already 3 Exchange Platforms, which trade Dentacoin, meaning that Dentacoin already has a <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/assets\/dentacoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market price<\/a>. Each platform is a separate market, therefore the price of Dentacoin on each of these 3 platforms is different. This is not just the case of Dentacoin, but also with all cryptocurrencies, which are on the market.<\/p>\n<p>In an ICO, there can be a specific goal or limit for project funding, meaning that every token will have a pre-designated price that will not change during the Initial Coin Offering period, which also means that the token supply is static. It is also possible to have a static supply with a dynamic funding goal, in which the distribution of tokens will be made according to the funds received; meaning that the more money the project receives, the higher the token price will be.<\/p>\n<p>ICOs enthusiasts currently worry over the recent intervention by <strong>Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)<\/strong> over a purported regulation of the digital coins that the coins should be put up as securities. SEC concludes that digital coins issued by the startup should serve the same purpose as traditional shares. This poses a central problem, to sell ICOs as published by the traditional corporations but ICOs remain popular.\u00a0 Despite what seems like a legal burden, ICOs are unlikely to lose investments and according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/michaeldurkheimer\/2017\/08\/15\/despite-sec-regulation-icos-are-unlikely-to-lose-their-investors\/#180ea87f7475\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forbes\u00a0stats<\/a>- \u201cThe value of Bitcoin has increased over 400% in January 2017, and the market value is about $70 billion, with about 16.5 million Bitcoins in circulation.\u00a0 Etherum has also had a more dramatic rise, with over 3,500% increase in value and almost $27 billion in new wealth for the coin holders\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>ICO is designed to secure funds for an early-stage company, issuing a token, cryptocurrency, and selling its supply to an audience as a tradable asset with much potential for growth. In 2016, Golem, Iconomi, and Waves platform made $103 million in 64 campaigns. The CEO of Waves Platform Alexander Ivanov Quotes that- <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/ico-market-from-6000-to-150-mln-overview-with-waves-ceo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Demand for ICOs is real and people are turning to it as an alternative to access funds for start-ups. The project is fast, granting funds where Venture Capitalists and bank loans can\u2019t be obtained<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4><strong><br \/>\nDefining Market Price<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Economists say the current price of an asset or service is the market price. It is also described as being determined by the forces of demand and supply- a result of interactions between investors, traders, and dealers. Market price is determined by quotes from dealers who represent buyers, using a bid and asking price. The dealer buys at his deal price and sells at the asking price of the market. The price derivation formula depends on some bids available to the offers by sellers \u2013 if external forces demand more volume, dealers will make the stocks available at the offer. This adjusts the market price either negatively or positively. Thus prices are not fixed without interactions from both directions.<\/p>\n<p>Shares are being traded on the exchange even after <a href=\"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/i\/ipo.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Initial Public Offering (IPO)<\/strong><\/a> because of the perceived value of company changes over time. Investors can make or lose money depending on whether their perceptions are in agreement with \"the market\u201d. Investors monitor moment-to-moment fluctuations in stock prices, to check how well the stocks are faring. The ultimate goal of buying shares is to make money by buying stocks in companies you expect to do well, those whose perceived value (in the form of the stock price) will rise. When you buy shares of a company, you own a piece of that business and therefore have a vote in how it is run. Investors don\u2019t all have the same agenda in the exchange, and a stock can\u2019t be sold when there is no buyer, this sometimes causes aggression as dealers look for buyers. Prices also remain low until wealthy buyers step in.<\/p>\n<p>Market Price in its IPO also has its risks \u2013 analysts have found it difficult to interpret how well stocks will fare on the initial day and the future because there are shareholders who could seemingly pull out of the company. IPOs are also for enterprises going through the growth period, with much uncertainty about their future.<\/p>\n<h4><strong><br \/>\nBottom line <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Investors do not use fiat money to buy ICOs. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are employed to purchase in the blockchain. Stocks are traded when a company needs money or when a seller, perceives a better investment elsewhere which sometimes puts the capital market in shock. The market price and ICOs are independent of each other, but ICOs offer alternatives as a way to diversify wealth because the human forces determine the stock exchange.<\/p>\n<p>However, with the decentralized platform of ICOs, it gives the community protections, and its blockchain design allows people to issue their tokens without restrictions and collectively vote for the viability of the project.<br \/>\n<strong>Next <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/ico\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">token sale of Dentacoin is planned for October 2017<\/a>, when 1 USD Cent will buy 85.3 Dentacoins.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n\t<hr>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>\n\t\t\tOriginally published at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/how-ico-price-and-market-price-are-different-and-why-one-doesnt-depend-on-the-other\/\">Dentacoin Blog<\/a>.\t\t<\/em>\n\t<\/p>\n\t","tags":["dentacoin","exchange platforms","ico","ipo","market price","reviews","token sale"],"contentFormat":"html","canonicalUrl":"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/how-ico-price-and-market-price-are-different-and-why-one-doesnt-depend-on-the-other\/","license":"all-rights-reserved","publishStatus":"public","publishedAt":"2017-08-21T09:39:03+00:00","notifyFollowers":true}

While a lot of people are panicking that ICOs are banned in China, it\u2019s important to understand the facts so you don\u2019t spend time worrying about the wrong thing.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>What is an ICO?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>First, let\u2019s define ICO.<\/p>\n<p>ICO stands for Initial Coin Offering, which is a method used by startups all over the world to raise capital for their projects. It is usually done by creating a custom token and offering it in exchange for more universal cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There are new ICOs almost every day, in efforts to collect funds for new projects and ideas. In order to get into an ICO, one needs to buy Bitcoin or Ether. Most ICOs are built on the Ethereum Blockchain, therefore Ether price has seen such huge increase the past few months. So new ICOs really increased Ether demand and price.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So if the world\u2019s second largest economy, China, doesn\u2019t want Ethereum, how will that affect the market?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>But Why Does China Have a Problem with ICOs?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Over 1\/5<sup>th<\/sup> of world\u2019s ICOs have been raised in China. That is over half a billion dollars in China alone. Over the past weekend <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-09-04\/china-central-bank-says-initial-coin-offerings-are-illegal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">China announced<\/a>\u00a0that it will require ICO-funded companies, which do not meet the qualifications, to return money to investors. This is a protective measure for regular investors from losing their savings.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>What Does This Mean for Startups in China? <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While it seems like all is lost for China\u2019s ICO marketplace, the truth is that Chinese citizens can still engage with cryptocurrencies. In fact, China has been a big supporter of cryptocurrencies in the market for some time. The ban does not include the buying or selling of cryptocurrencies in the world market, just the use of cryptocurrencies to fund business ventures. As mentioned above, around 1\/5th of all the world\u2019s ICOs have been raised in China, but many of them have turned out to be fraudulent or have failed. So while people are worried about how this will impact the world\u2019s digital market, it\u2019s important to remember that not all cryptocurrencies are off limits. It is very logical that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ICO demand will be focused\u00a0on European<\/a> and US projects for the following months.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>How Can China Still Get in on the Action?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Even though the government has banned ICOs, investors, developers and startups can still access cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>What Other Impacts Might This Ban Have? <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to know for sure, but <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitcoin and Ether have been tumbling<\/a> for some time now, and saw a large drop in value after the announcement from the Chinese government this week.

This is a unique business model, which uses the natural shape and state of the existing industry and introduces efficiencies on specific problems.<\/p>\n<p>The mission of Dentacoin is to improve access to quality dental care and make it accessible for everyone. Through developing and implementing a number<!--more--> of Blockchain-based tools*, introducing 2 innovative dental clinic concepts** and the creation of a custom token*** which serves all products, Dentacoin sets the road to a revolution for the entire dental industry.<\/p>\n<p>*Trusted Review Platform, AfterCare App, Webapp for collective customer intelligence, Dental Insurance Model, Trading Platform and HealthCare Database.<\/p>\n<p>**F3T Clinic and City Clinic Concepts, developed as pilot-clinic-concepts, Blockchain-integrated, highly efficient, as future models for the global dental industry.<\/p>\n<p>***Dentacoin ERC20 token is already traded on international exchange platforms and has a market price exceeding the fundamental price.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Three Birds, One Stone<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Efficient social and business solutions address multiple problems at the same time because problems are interrelated.\u00a0 Focusing with laser-like precision on one aspect of one problem can produce more unintended consequences than effective solutions.\u00a0 Prohibition in the United States is a classic example.\u00a0 Making alcohol illegal did not solve the social problems caused by alcoholism and brought in a host of illegal activity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Dentacoin Foundation is dedicated to solving a $400 billion global problem.\u00a0 The problem is poor dental care, and $400 billion is a conservative estimate of the amount spent on preventable dental problems.\u00a0 The Dentacoin Foundation has identified three factors that contribute to this problem and is implementing a unique blockchain solution that addresses all three.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Three Problems<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The first problem is that the financial incentives of dentists and their patients do not line up.\u00a0 Dentists are paid for the amount of work they do, so a patient with more dental problems is more profitable.\u00a0 Dental treatments that prevent long-term problems are economically disastrous for dentists.\u00a0 Patients, of course, simply want to avoid dental work as much as possible and are generally unwilling to pay for preventative care.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The second problem is that individuals are typically averse to going to the dentist and to developing good dental hygiene habits.\u00a0 While everyone wants the benefits of healthy teeth and gums, the small steps necessary to accomplish that goal do not seem worth the bother.\u00a0 As a result, most individuals only seek dental care when there is a medical crisis, which fits into the dentist\u2019s profitably model.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The third problem is that it costs dentists more and more each year to find enough patients.\u00a0 Each patient who comes for major dental work is profitable, but then has to be replaced with another patient who, again, needs major dental work.\u00a0 Marketing and advertising are consuming a larger percentage of the operating budget of the modern dental practice.\u00a0 These resources are not directed toward patient care or profitability.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is easy to see how these three problems feed on each other.\u00a0 The financial incentives of dentists hinder preventative care, which encourages patients to disregard it as well.\u00a0 Marketing is focused on problem solving because that is the most profitable, which sends a message that any dental problem can be fixed.\u00a0 This also provides a financial incentive for patients to ignore a small problem because it might not turn into a major problem.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>One Solution<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A new cryptocurrency with its supporting programs will provide the broad-based solutions necessary to break this negative cycle and reduce the $400 billion in wasteful spending.\u00a0 The cryptocurrency is Dentacoin.\u00a0 The support programs are functional tools, among which is a Dentacoin Insurance and the already implemented Trusted Review Platform.\u00a0 All these solutions are enabled by blockchain technology, a ground-breaking approach to information and transaction security that will revolutionize industries.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Dentacoin currency can be used to pay monthly premiums on an innovative dental insurance program executed on the blockchain.\u00a0 Patients pay one low premium in the currency every month.\u00a0 A portion of each premium goes into a shared-risk reinsurance pool.\u00a0 Dentists will be paid every month with the currency regardless of the treatment provided to the patient.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In this way the insurance model rewards the dentist for keeping the patient in good dental health.\u00a0 The patient is rewarded by receiving all their dental care at the price of the low monthly premium and, as part of the insurance contract, agrees to practice good dental hygiene on a regular basis.\u00a0 This brings the financial interests of the dentist and the patient into complete alignment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The same dynamic takes place to solve the problem of marketing costs.\u00a0 The already operating Trusted Review Platform encourages patients to contribute unedited reviews of the care they receive to a permanent file on the blockchain.\u00a0 New patients can read the unfiltered reviews when looking for a dentist, reducing or eliminating the need to spend money on marketing for the dentist. He, on the other side, can take this feedback and apply changes to improve the quality of the services he provides.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This reinforcing cycle of aligned economic interests is a new dynamic that can disrupt the status quo of the dental industry.\u00a0 Just like trucks disrupted the railroad industry and electricity disrupted oil lamps, these blockchain applications can usher in a new, more financially efficient dental industry that looks very different from the ways dental care is provided today.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Why Blockchain<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain technology provides decentralized security for important information.\u00a0 It also creates a \u201crelationship super-highway\u201d that allows two individuals to transact business without intermediaries.\u00a0 Blockchain technology provides these and other benefits at a very low cost and without barriers to entry.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain is simply copies of a ledger on multiple computers that verifies each copy as it posts new transactions to the ledger.\u00a0 The ledger can contain information on the ownership of a cryptocurrency, the reviews of dental practices, or transfers between parties.\u00a0 Any important information can be stored permanently and cheaply on a blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Creating a blockchain means either starting from scratch or using an existing infrastructure.\u00a0 The Dentacoin Foundation has taken the latter approach and is utilizing the Ethereum platform to create the Dentacoin Concept.\u00a0 This minimizes the initial costs and shortens the development time.\u00a0 It also creates greater long term security as the platform is used by more blockchain applications.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Dentacoin Foundation sees blockchain technology as a means to an end.\u00a0 The cryptocurrency, the insurance plan and the patient reviews are three of the ways the power of blockchain is brought to bear on the current problems of the global dental industry.\u00a0 $400 billion is too much money to waste every year, and improving dental health worldwide is too important to postpone.<\/p>\n","tags":["blockchain","cryptocurrency","dentacoin","DENTAL","feedback","industry","insurance","introduction","marketing","problems","solution"],"contentFormat":"html","canonicalUrl":"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/a-beginners-guide-to-dentacoin\/","license":null,"publishStatus":null,"publishedAt":"2017-09-12T10:10:40+00:00","notifyFollowers":false}

It\u2019s vital.<\/h3>\n<p><strong>\u2022 For global coverage and long-term success, we certainly need enough coins.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The minimum required volume of any currency in order to have a chance for global use is 5% of the total world currencies volume. Today, all of the world\u2019s money equals USD 160 trillion and 8 trillion DCN is an equivalent to approximately 5% of this amount.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at just one of the Dentacoin tools. The pilot project of Dentacoin \u2013 the Trusted Review platform - is already developed as the first Blockchain-based, tamper-resistant and transparent platform for dental treatment reviews worldwide. It is already functioning on the main Ethereum network even before the ICO, i.e. patient are being rewarded with DCN for their detailed and valuable feedback. The planned daily users only of this first tool is up to 3 000 000 users (3 million users), each of which will be rewarded with a certain amount of Dentacoins.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s just one of the Dentacoin tools\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 We need Dentacoins to serve all of our value-generating tools for global use.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are two ways you can get Dentacoins: 1) by purchasing it; 2) by earning it. Approx. 40% of the total DCN supply are reserved for <strong>BUYING<\/strong> (ICO and presale activities, crowdfunding), another 20% are to be utilized by the Dentacoin Foundation for development of tools, marketing activities, bounty programs, future projects and unpredicted expenses. The last 40% left are reserved for <strong>EARNING<\/strong> (through tools and value-generating activities, contributing to the improvement of the dental industry).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here comes the tricky part. Tricky due its uniqueness.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On its way to solve the industry\u2019s most pressing problems, Dentacoin implements an one-of-a-kind \u201cvalue-generating\u201d distribution model. Through numerous Blockchain-based tools, Dentacoin aims at bringing patients and dentists into communities, working together to improve dental care worldwide and make it affordable. All these tools are served by the Dentacoin token, meaning that users are rewarded with DCN for their work, for their contribution to the Foundation\u2019s mission.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the real-world purpose of Dentacoin, its target group has much bigger size than most of the Blockchain-based projects and it consists of more than 600 Mio users (patients and dentists). The distribution model of Dentacoin spreads the currency among the target user group, brings all market participants together into co-working communities and thus generates value for the whole industry. This powerful network is expected to trigger network effects where adding a new participant increases the value of the network for all existing participants. Or as \u201cThe Merkle\u201d described it:<\/p>\n<p><em>\"40% of the total DCN supply will be distributed among millions of people who contribute to the mission of Dentacoin. This will result in creating millions of wallets, generating mass distribution and activating the crowd to use this token. The potential user group of Dentacoin extends far beyond the closed Blockchain community.\"<\/em> <strong>The Merkle<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s just it.

It\u2019s vital.<\/h3>\n<p><strong>\u2022 For global coverage and long-term success, we certainly need enough coins.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The minimum required volume of any currency in order to have a chance for global use is 5% of the total world currencies volume. Today, all of the world\u2019s money equals USD 160 trillion and 8 trillion DCN is an equivalent to approximately 5% of this amount.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at just one of the Dentacoin tools. The pilot project of Dentacoin \u2013 the Trusted Review platform - is already developed as the first Blockchain-based, tamper-resistant and transparent platform for dental treatment reviews worldwide. It is already functioning on the main Ethereum network even before the ICO, i.e. patient are being rewarded with DCN for their detailed and valuable feedback. The planned daily users only of this first tool is up to 3 000 000 users (3 million users), each of which will be rewarded with a certain amount of Dentacoins.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s just one of the Dentacoin tools\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 We need Dentacoins to serve all of our value-generating tools for global use.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are two ways you can get Dentacoins: 1) by purchasing it; 2) by earning it. Approx. 40% of the total DCN supply are reserved for <strong>BUYING<\/strong> (ICO and presale activities, crowdfunding), another 20% are to be utilized by the Dentacoin Foundation for development of tools, marketing activities, bounty programs, future projects and unpredicted expenses. The last 40% left are reserved for <strong>EARNING<\/strong> (through tools and value-generating activities, contributing to the improvement of the dental industry).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here comes the tricky part. Tricky due its uniqueness.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On its way to solve the industry\u2019s most pressing problems, Dentacoin implements an one-of-a-kind \u201cvalue-generating\u201d distribution model. Through numerous Blockchain-based tools, Dentacoin aims at bringing patients and dentists into communities, working together to improve dental care worldwide and make it affordable. All these tools are served by the Dentacoin token, meaning that users are rewarded with DCN for their work, for their contribution to the Foundation\u2019s mission.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the real-world purpose of Dentacoin, its target group has much bigger size than most of the Blockchain-based projects and it consists of more than 600 Mio users (patients and dentists). The distribution model of Dentacoin spreads the currency among the target user group, brings all market participants together into co-working communities and thus generates value for the whole industry. This powerful network is expected to trigger network effects where adding a new participant increases the value of the network for all existing participants. Or as \u201cThe Merkle\u201d described it:<\/p>\n<p><em>\"40% of the total DCN supply will be distributed among millions of people who contribute to the mission of Dentacoin. This will result in creating millions of wallets, generating mass distribution and activating the crowd to use this token. The potential user group of Dentacoin extends far beyond the closed Blockchain community.\"<\/em> <strong>The Merkle<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s just it. No more, no less.<\/p>\n<p>You are still free to consider us crazy though. But you know what they say: \u201cThe people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yours,<br \/>\nDentacoin Team<\/p>\n\t<hr>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>\n\t\t\tOriginally published at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/crazy-enough-to-premine-8-trillion-dentacoins\/\">Dentacoin Blog<\/a>.\t\t<\/em>\n\t<\/p>\n\t","tags":["bitcoin","dentacoin","dentistry","ethereum"],"contentFormat":"html","canonicalUrl":"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/crazy-enough-to-premine-8-trillion-dentacoins\/","license":"all-rights-reserved","publishStatus":"public","publishedAt":"2017-09-12T10:58:25+00:00","notifyFollowers":true}

It\u2019s vital.<\/h3>\n<p><strong>\u2022 For global coverage and long-term success, we certainly need enough coins.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The minimum required volume of any currency in order to have a chance for global use is 5% of the total world currencies volume. Today, all of the world\u2019s money equals USD 160 trillion and 8 trillion DCN is an equivalent to approximately 5% of this amount.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at just one of the Dentacoin tools. The pilot project of Dentacoin \u2013 the Trusted Review platform - is already developed as the first Blockchain-based, tamper-resistant and transparent platform for dental treatment reviews worldwide. It is already functioning on the main Ethereum network even before the ICO, i.e. patient are being rewarded with DCN for their detailed and valuable feedback. The planned daily users only of this first tool is up to 3 000 000 users (3 million users), each of which will be rewarded with a certain amount of Dentacoins.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s just one of the Dentacoin tools\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 We need Dentacoins to serve all of our value-generating tools for global use.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are two ways you can get Dentacoins: 1) by purchasing it; 2) by earning it. Approx. 40% of the total DCN supply are reserved for <strong>BUYING<\/strong> (ICO and presale activities, crowdfunding), another 20% are to be utilized by the Dentacoin Foundation for development of tools, marketing activities, bounty programs, future projects and unpredicted expenses. The last 40% left are reserved for <strong>EARNING<\/strong> (through tools and value-generating activities, contributing to the improvement of the dental industry).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here comes the tricky part. Tricky due its uniqueness.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On its way to solve the industry\u2019s most pressing problems, Dentacoin implements an one-of-a-kind \u201cvalue-generating\u201d distribution model. Through numerous Blockchain-based tools, Dentacoin aims at bringing patients and dentists into communities, working together to improve dental care worldwide and make it affordable. All these tools are served by the Dentacoin token, meaning that users are rewarded with DCN for their work, for their contribution to the Foundation\u2019s mission.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the real-world purpose of Dentacoin, its target group has much bigger size than most of the Blockchain-based projects and it consists of more than 600 Mio users (patients and dentists). The distribution model of Dentacoin spreads the currency among the target user group, brings all market participants together into co-working communities and thus generates value for the whole industry. This powerful network is expected to trigger network effects where adding a new participant increases the value of the network for all existing participants. Or as \u201cThe Merkle\u201d described it:<\/p>\n<p><em>\"40% of the total DCN supply will be distributed among millions of people who contribute to the mission of Dentacoin. This will result in creating millions of wallets, generating mass distribution and activating the crowd to use this token. The potential user group of Dentacoin extends far beyond the closed Blockchain community.\"<\/em> <strong>The Merkle<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s just it. No more, no less.<\/p>\n<p>You are still free to consider us crazy though.

Value?","content":"<h1>Cryptocurrency: What Creates Value?<\/h1>\n<h4><strong>Creating Value, Not Coins<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies have attracted significant attention recently because of the tremendous \u201cvalue\u201d associated with Bitcoin.\u00a0 What many people fail to realize is that the Bitcoin model relies completely on the simple application of supply and demand.\u00a0 Because demand has been so high, the model appears to work.\u00a0 However, that may change dramatically if speculators decide to end their demand for the coin.<\/p>\n<p>A far more sustainable model is being created by Dentacoin, the first industry specific digital coin created for the global dental industry.\u00a0 This unique approach to cryptocurrency changes the underlying creation of value from a basic supply and demand model to a value creation and reward model.\u00a0 This latter form of economic model is the basis for a Value Added Tax (VAT).<\/p>\n<p>In the world of cryptocurrency, creating value is known as mining.\u00a0 Up to now mining has been limited to creating new coins, and under this model so long as the demand for the coins exceeds the supply mining is a lucrative activity.\u00a0 However, Dentacoin will create value by creating better global health.\u00a0 When the effectiveness of this approach is seen and understood, the community of dentists and patients will grow.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>What Creates Value?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Dentacoin believes that actions that promote better global dental health create value.\u00a0 There can be little argument about this core premise.\u00a0 Dentacoin also believes that anyone who contributes to the effort to create a healthier dental environment should be compensated for that contribution.\u00a0 Again, that premise is also simply understood and accepted.<\/p>\n<p>Dentacoin is engineered to make those goals a reality.\u00a0 It seeks to change the dental industry by bringing the financial interests of dentists and patients into perfect alignment behind the goal of better dental health.\u00a0 As these participants contribute, they will be rewarded with Dentacoin.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/reviews.dentacoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trusted Review Platform<\/a> is one example.\u00a0 Honest feedback of the quality of care a patient received at a dental clinic are valuable information, if those reviews are unedited and secure.\u00a0 Blockchain technology provides this security.\u00a0 Patients who contribute a feedback of their care are paid for their work with Dentacoin.<\/p>\n<p>Other potential patients can read the uncensored feedback and gain valuable insight into the quality of care they can expect from that clinic.\u00a0 Assuming the clinic does a good job, they will find it valuable to have the feedback from patients and implement changes where needed, thus improving due to direct customer feedback.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Other Value Creation<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Small acts of good dental hygiene also contribute to better global dental health, and through a mobile app these can be encouraged and rewarded with Dentacoin.\u00a0 A dentist who has made a commitment to improving the dental health of that patient will be glad to see them brushing and flossing regularly.\u00a0 Each small act of value creation can be rewarded with Dentacoin.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike Bitcoin, the Dentacoin community will have a long-term stake in the continued success of Dentacoin because they have a desire to see a long-term improvement in dental health.\u00a0 In contrast, a significant percentage of the value of <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/bitcoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitcoin has been created by short-term speculators<\/a> who have no interest in the success of the coin after they sell their holdings.<\/p>\n<p>A sustained, long-term interest on the part of a <a href=\"https:\/\/themerkle.com\/dentacoin-has-over-20000-supporters-now\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">growing community<\/a> will support a <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/assets\/dentacoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">growing demand for Dentacoin<\/a>, supporting a market value that will attract more participants into the community.\u00a0 This will create sustainable value, not speculative value.\u00a0 Positive results will be rewarded through Dentacoin, and the success of the community will be rewarded by increases in the value of this unique digital currency.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>A Balanced Supply<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>As the community grows, they will need a larger supply of Dentacoin to support their activities.\u00a0 This is perfectly analogous to a nation growing its GDP and creating more national currency to facilitate that growth.\u00a0 In both situations, there has to be enough currency available to give all the participants access to capital without stimulating inflation.<\/p>\n<p>Dentacoin has created a model to meet this need. \u00a0We have determined that the total global demand for Dentacoin, once it is fully accepted around the world, will be around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/crazy-enough-to-premine-8-trillion-dentacoins\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8 trillion coins<\/a>.\u00a0 So, we have created that number.\u00a0 These coins are already in existence and do not need to be created by further computer operators.\u00a0 That type of mining has no application in the Dentacoin community.<\/p>\n<p>Dentacoin does recognize that the initial community of Dentacoin uses will not be global, and that the community will grow over time.\u00a0 To preserve Dentacoin value in the early days of its use, only a small number of the 8 trillion coins will be released into circulation.\u00a0 There is a set <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/crazy-enough-to-premine-8-trillion-dentacoins\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">release schedule<\/a> to accommodate the growth of the global Dentacoin community.<\/p>\n<p>In this way, the basic rules of supply and demand are recognized while the true value of Dentacoin is determined by contributions to the global improvement in dental health.\u00a0 As the value of that improvement is recognized and more dentists and patients join the market, more Dentacoin will be issued, growing the supply to meet the growing demand.<\/p>\n<p>This is an unprecedented economic model in the world of cryptocurrencies, but it relies on very basic and well-established principals commonly practiced by developed nations.\u00a0 The melding of these principals with blockchain technology and an interest in personal and global dental health has the potential to create a compelling and sustainable value proposition that will attract both investors and participants alike.<\/p>\n<p>This article is written by F.

This is a unique business model, which uses the natural shape and state of the existing industry and introduces efficiencies on specific problems.<\/p>\n<p>The mission of Dentacoin is to improve access to quality dental care and make it accessible for everyone. Through developing and implementing a number<!--more--> of Blockchain-based tools*, introducing 2 innovative dental clinic concepts** and the creation of a custom token*** which serves all products, Dentacoin sets the road to a revolution for the entire dental industry.<\/p>\n<p>*Trusted Review Platform, AfterCare App, Webapp for collective customer intelligence, Dental Insurance Model, Trading Platform and HealthCare Database.<\/p>\n<p>**F3T Clinic and City Clinic Concepts, developed as pilot-clinic-concepts, Blockchain-integrated, highly efficient, as future models for the global dental industry.<\/p>\n<p>***Dentacoin ERC20 token is already traded on international exchange platforms and has a market price exceeding the fundamental price.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Three Birds, One Stone<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Efficient social and business solutions address multiple problems at the same time because problems are interrelated.\u00a0 Focusing with laser-like precision on one aspect of one problem can produce more unintended consequences than effective solutions.\u00a0 Prohibition in the United States is a classic example.\u00a0 Making alcohol illegal did not solve the social problems caused by alcoholism and brought in a host of illegal activity.<\/p>\n<p>The Dentacoin Foundation is dedicated to solving a $400 billion global problem.\u00a0 The problem is poor dental care, and $400 billion is a conservative estimate of the amount spent on preventable dental problems.\u00a0 The Dentacoin Foundation has identified three factors that contribute to this problem and is implementing a unique blockchain solution that addresses all three.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Three Problems<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The first problem is that the financial incentives of dentists and their patients do not line up.\u00a0 Dentists are paid for the amount of work they do, so a patient with more dental problems is more profitable.\u00a0 Dental treatments that prevent long-term problems are economically disastrous for dentists.\u00a0 Patients, of course, simply want to avoid dental work as much as possible and are generally unwilling to pay for preventative care.<\/p>\n<p>The second problem is that individuals are typically averse to going to the dentist and to developing good dental hygiene habits.\u00a0 While everyone wants the benefits of healthy teeth and gums, the small steps necessary to accomplish that goal do not seem worth the bother.\u00a0 As a result, most individuals only seek dental care when there is a medical crisis, which fits into the dentist\u2019s profitably model.<\/p>\n<p>The third problem is that it costs dentists more and more each year to find enough patients.\u00a0 Each patient who comes for major dental work is profitable, but then has to be replaced with another patient who, again, needs major dental work.\u00a0 Marketing and advertising are consuming a larger percentage of the operating budget of the modern dental practice.\u00a0 These resources are not directed toward patient care or profitability.<\/p>\n<p>It is easy to see how these three problems feed on each other.\u00a0 The financial incentives of dentists hinder preventative care, which encourages patients to disregard it as well.\u00a0 Marketing is focused on problem solving because that is the most profitable, which sends a message that any dental problem can be fixed.\u00a0 This also provides a financial incentive for patients to ignore a small problem because it might not turn into a major problem.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>One Solution<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>A new cryptocurrency with its supporting programs will provide the broad-based solutions necessary to break this negative cycle and reduce the $400 billion in wasteful spending.\u00a0 The cryptocurrency is Dentacoin.\u00a0 The support programs are functional tools, among which is a Dentacoin Insurance and the already implemented Trusted Review Platform.\u00a0 All these solutions are enabled by blockchain technology, a ground-breaking approach to information and transaction security that will revolutionize industries.<\/p>\n<p>The Dentacoin currency can be used to pay monthly premiums on an innovative dental insurance program executed on the blockchain.\u00a0 Patients pay one low premium in the currency every month.\u00a0 A portion of each premium goes into a shared-risk reinsurance pool.\u00a0 Dentists will be paid every month with the currency regardless of the treatment provided to the patient.<\/p>\n<p>In this way the insurance model rewards the dentist for keeping the patient in good dental health.\u00a0 The patient is rewarded by receiving all their dental care at the price of the low monthly premium and, as part of the insurance contract, agrees to practice good dental hygiene on a regular basis.\u00a0 This brings the financial interests of the dentist and the patient into complete alignment.<\/p>\n<p>The same dynamic takes place to solve the problem of marketing costs.\u00a0 The already operating Trusted Review Platform encourages patients to contribute unedited reviews of the care they receive to a permanent file on the blockchain.\u00a0 New patients can read the unfiltered reviews when looking for a dentist, reducing or eliminating the need to spend money on marketing for the dentist. He, on the other side, can take this feedback and apply changes to improve the quality of the services he provides.<\/p>\n<p>This reinforcing cycle of aligned economic interests is a new dynamic that can disrupt the status quo of the dental industry.\u00a0 Just like trucks disrupted the railroad industry and electricity disrupted oil lamps, these blockchain applications can usher in a new, more financially efficient dental industry that looks very different from the ways dental care is provided today.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Why Blockchain<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Blockchain technology provides decentralized security for important information.\u00a0 It also creates a \u201crelationship super-highway\u201d that allows two individuals to transact business without intermediaries.\u00a0 Blockchain technology provides these and other benefits at a very low cost and without barriers to entry.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain is simply copies of a ledger on multiple computers that verifies each copy as it posts new transactions to the ledger.\u00a0 The ledger can contain information on the ownership of a cryptocurrency, the reviews of dental practices, or transfers between parties.\u00a0 Any important information can be stored permanently and cheaply on a blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>Creating a blockchain means either starting from scratch or using an existing infrastructure.\u00a0 The Dentacoin Foundation has taken the latter approach and is utilizing the Ethereum platform to create the Dentacoin Concept.\u00a0 This minimizes the initial costs and shortens the development time.\u00a0 It also creates greater long term security as the platform is used by more blockchain applications.<\/p>\n<p>The Dentacoin Foundation sees blockchain technology as a means to an end.\u00a0 The cryptocurrency, the insurance plan and the patient reviews are three of the ways the power of blockchain is brought to bear on the current problems of the global dental industry.\u00a0 $400 billion is too much money to waste every year, and improving dental health worldwide is too important to postpone.<\/p>\n\t<hr>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>\n\t\t\tOriginally published at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/a-beginners-guide-to-dentacoin\/\">Dentacoin blog<\/a>.\t\t<\/em>\n\t<\/p>\n\t","tags":["blockchain","cryptocurrency","dentacoin","DENTAL","feedback","industry","insurance","introduction","marketing","problems","solution"],"contentFormat":"html","canonicalUrl":"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/a-beginners-guide-to-dentacoin\/","license":"all-rights-reserved","publishStatus":"public","publishedAt":"2017-09-12T10:10:40+00:00","notifyFollowers":true}

While a lot of people are panicking that ICOs are banned in China, it\u2019s important to understand the facts so you don\u2019t spend time worrying about the wrong thing.<!--more--><\/p>\n<h4><strong>What is an ICO?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>First, let\u2019s define ICO.<\/p>\n<p>ICO stands for Initial Coin Offering, which is a method used by startups all over the world to raise capital for their projects. It is usually done by creating a custom token and offering it in exchange for more universal cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<p>There are new ICOs almost every day, in efforts to collect funds for new projects and ideas. In order to get into an ICO, one needs to buy Bitcoin or Ether. Most ICOs are built on the Ethereum Blockchain, therefore Ether price has seen such huge increase the past few months. So new ICOs really increased Ether demand and price.<\/p>\n<p>So if the world\u2019s second largest economy, China, doesn\u2019t want Ethereum, how will that affect the market?<\/p>\n<h4><strong>But Why Does China Have a Problem with ICOs?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Over 1\/5<sup>th<\/sup> of world\u2019s ICOs have been raised in China. That is over half a billion dollars in China alone. Over the past weekend <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-09-04\/china-central-bank-says-initial-coin-offerings-are-illegal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">China announced<\/a>\u00a0that it will require ICO-funded companies, which do not meet the qualifications, to return money to investors. This is a protective measure for regular investors from losing their savings.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>What Does This Mean for Startups in China? <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>While it seems like all is lost for China\u2019s ICO marketplace, the truth is that Chinese citizens can still engage with cryptocurrencies. In fact, China has been a big supporter of cryptocurrencies in the market for some time. The ban does not include the buying or selling of cryptocurrencies in the world market, just the use of cryptocurrencies to fund business ventures. As mentioned above, around 1\/5th of all the world\u2019s ICOs have been raised in China, but many of them have turned out to be fraudulent or have failed. So while people are worried about how this will impact the world\u2019s digital market, it\u2019s important to remember that not all cryptocurrencies are off limits. It is very logical that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ICO demand will be focused\u00a0on European<\/a> and US projects for the following months.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>How Can China Still Get in on the Action?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Even though the government has banned ICOs, investors, developers and startups can still access cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>What Other Impacts Might This Ban Have? <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to know for sure, but <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitcoin and Ether have been tumbling<\/a> for some time now, and saw a large drop in value after the announcement from the Chinese government this week. While they have recovered, it is important to remember that markets are volatile and many factors influence their current market caps and values.<\/p>\n<p>Blaming China\u2019s announcement on the dip and not seeing new opportunities which are likely to emerge that will continue to fuel the cryptocurrency market and the world\u2019s economy for the better is not impossible.<\/p>\n<p>It could be that China is just trying to create some space in the market and create its own coin. \u201cSomething it (China) has more control over, more visibility. Because it does recognize the value brought from cryptocurrency and having a completely digital economy.\u201d As seen in an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-09-04\/china-central-bank-says-initial-coin-offerings-are-illegal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interview<\/a>\u00a0with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ynakamura56\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yuji Nakamura<\/a>\u00a0from Bloomberg News.<\/p>\n\t<hr>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>\n\t\t\tOriginally published at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/china-bans-icos-what-does-it-really-mean\/\">Dentacoin blog<\/a>.\t\t<\/em>\n\t<\/p>\n\t","tags":["ban","bitcoin","Bloomberg","china","dentacoin","ether","ico","news","PBOC"],"contentFormat":"html","canonicalUrl":"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/china-bans-icos-what-does-it-really-mean\/","license":"all-rights-reserved","publishStatus":"public","publishedAt":"2017-09-08T10:21:47+00:00","notifyFollowers":true}

We have communicated the correct amount to <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CoinMarketCap<\/a>, and recently the changes have been implemented.<\/p>\n<p>At the moment, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/crazy-enough-to-premine-8-trillion-dentacoins\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">96.2% of the total Dentacoin supply is locked<\/a> in timelock smart contracts. The rest, which is around 3.8% is circulating, thus accessible for potential trading.<\/p>\n<p>This 3.8% of the total supply of Dentacoin was distributed in the following events:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dentaprime International plc. (purchased entirely in DCN) \u2013 June 2017<\/li>\n<li>Presale in July 2017<\/li>\n<li>Partners and medias, who have contributed to improving the awareness of Dentacoin - February 2017 \u2013 to this moment<\/li>\n<li>Presale Bounty Program, before July 2017<\/li>\n<li>Trusted Review Platform (constantly distributing Dentacoin to new registered users) \u2013 Sept 2017 \u2013 to this moment<\/li>\n<li>Core Team, upon starting the project in February 2017<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/ico\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The upcoming ICO<\/a> will offer another 3% of the total Dentacoin supply to the market. Please keep in mind that the ICO price was fixed a few months ago and it was set to approx. 0,00011723 USD per DCN. Since Dentacoin can only be bought for another cryptocurrency, we will set the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/great-news-during-the-ico-you-will-also-be-able-to-buy-dentacoin-with-bitcoin-btc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exact exchange rate for the ICO<\/a> on Monday, 25th Sept 2017.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Balanced Supply<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As explained previously, Dentacoin has an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/cryptocurrency-what-creates-value\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">intelligent distribution mechanism<\/a> which will ensure that the amount of available Dentacoin grows simultaneously to the demand and awareness.

Developers can build applications for communities and businesses while keeping communication safe and secure. <!--more-->George Hallam, Ethereum\u2019s external relations director, shares\u00a0that \u201cEthereum is essentially a programmable blockchain that puts the user in control. Rather than lock users to a set of pre-defined applications within the protocol, Ethereum allows them to create their own applications in the form of Smart Contracts (DApps), which can be as complex as required. This significantly increases the versatility and capability of the Ethereum blockchain as a whole.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A zero\u00a0infrastructure platform, Ethereum is described by its developers as\u00a0a \"censorship-proof planetary scale computer, where users always stay in control of their funds and personal data\".<\/p>\n<p>The video below explains further the basic functionality of Ethereum:<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n\t<hr>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>\n\t\t\tOriginally published at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/video-what-is-ethereum\/\">Dentacoin blog<\/a>.\t\t<\/em>\n\t<\/p>\n\t","tags":["cryptocurrency","dentacoin","ethereum"],"contentFormat":"html","canonicalUrl":"http:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/video-what-is-ethereum\/","license":"all-rights-reserved","publishStatus":"public","publishedAt":"2017-05-23T19:27:56+00:00","notifyFollowers":true}

This pre-ICO period marked significant success from a point of view of gaining awareness towards our project, attracting more members of the Dentacoin community and getting support from more and more exchange platforms. As you already know, we launched our ICO on October, the 1st and during the ICO you are able to buy Dentacoin at a special fixed rate of 0.00000003 BTC\/DCN or 0.0000004 ETH\/DCN. The purchase can happen on our website (against ETH), through MyEtherWallet (ETH), imToken (ETH), as well as on exchange platforms like Cryptopia (ETH\/BTH), HitBTC (ETH\/BTC\/USDT), Coinexchange (ETH\/BTC), Mercatox (ETH\/BTC), BuyUcoin (INR).<\/p>\n<p>Now we are happy to announce that Dentacoin is also supported in Coinomi Wallet!<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is Coinomi? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Coinomi is a lightweight, secure, universal, HD Wallet available for Android, being the largest and oldest active multi-coin thin wallet in the market supporting over 80 blockchains and 200 tokens. \u00a0Your private keys never leave your device and setting up the application takes only a few minutes. Its user-friendliness and elevated level of security are among the key benefits of Coinomi that make us glad to have Dentacoin (DCN) supported. Another key feature which will be of high interest to all Dentacoin holders is the potential instant in-app exchange between altcoins from within the app if we are supported on either Changelly or ShapeShift exchange.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u00a0\u201cDentacoin is a project which aims at opening the market for Blockchain into the everyday life, just like our wallet which allows users to access their currencies safely at any time. Its real-world purpose and a clear long-term vision are admirable. The potential to change a whole industry by activating the decentralized power of the crowd through a custom-made token is what first grabbed our attention. We are very glad to be part of this movement \u201c, <\/em>said Coinomi CEO George Kimionis.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>How to buy Dentacoin (DCN) using Coinomi?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Coinomi will also allow you to easily contribute to the Dentacoin ICO with one simple click. The purchase from within the app will be available against Ether (ETH). What is the process?<br \/>\nOne option is to just send the desired amount of ETH to the Dentacoin smart contract by making a standard transaction.<\/p>\n<p>Another option is to click on the announcement of the Dentacoin ICO in Coinomi.

This pre-ICO period marked significant success from a point of view of gaining awareness towards our project, attracting more members of the Dentacoin community and getting support from more and more exchange platforms. As you already know, we launched our ICO on October, the 1st and during the ICO you are able to buy Dentacoin at a special fixed rate of 0.00000003 BTC\/DCN or 0.0000004 ETH\/DCN. The purchase can happen on our website (against ETH), through MyEtherWallet (ETH), imToken (ETH), as well as on exchange platforms like Cryptopia (ETH\/BTH), HitBTC (ETH\/BTC\/USDT), Coinexchange (ETH\/BTC), Mercatox (ETH\/BTC), BuyUcoin (INR).<\/p>\n<p>Now we are happy to announce that Dentacoin is also supported in Coinomi Wallet!<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is Coinomi? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Coinomi is a lightweight, secure, universal, HD Wallet available for Android, being the largest and oldest active multi-coin thin wallet in the market supporting over 80 blockchains and 200 tokens. \u00a0Your private keys never leave your device and setting up the application takes only a few minutes. Its user-friendliness and elevated level of security are among the key benefits of Coinomi that make us glad to have Dentacoin (DCN) supported. Another key feature which will be of high interest to all Dentacoin holders is the potential instant in-app exchange between altcoins from within the app if we are supported on either Changelly or ShapeShift exchange.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u00a0\u201cDentacoin is a project which aims at opening the market for Blockchain into the everyday life, just like our wallet which allows users to access their currencies safely at any time. Its real-world purpose and a clear long-term vision are admirable. The potential to change a whole industry by activating the decentralized power of the crowd through a custom-made token is what first grabbed our attention. We are very glad to be part of this movement \u201c, <\/em>said Coinomi CEO George Kimionis.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>How to buy Dentacoin (DCN) using Coinomi?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Coinomi will also allow you to easily contribute to the Dentacoin ICO with one simple click. The purchase from within the app will be available against Ether (ETH). What is the process?<br \/>\nOne option is to just send the desired amount of ETH to the Dentacoin smart contract by making a standard transaction.<\/p>\n<p>Another option is to click on the announcement of the Dentacoin ICO in Coinomi. Then an ICO screen will pop up. You will have to choose a \"Pay from\" and a \"Receive with\" account, as well as the amount. Then you should agree to the Terms&amp;Conditions and click on \"Participate\". Note that the only available option for\u00a0\"Pay from\" and \"Receive with\" fields will be Ether (ETH).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Please note<\/strong>: The one and only contract address, allowing you to contribute to the Dentacoin ICO,\u00a0is published on our official ICO page:\u00a0<a class=\"yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/redirect?event=video_description&amp;v=76gWAM21-CI&amp;redir_token=pVrMxRr-Gr27-DiFsEZyWgpstRh8MTUwNjk0MTgwOUAxNTA2ODU1NDA5&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fdentacoin.com%2Fico%2F\">https:\/\/dentacoin.com\/ico\/<\/a>.

Around 15 billion DCN will be circulating additionally after the ICO.<\/p>\n<p>Dentacoin has been used as means of payment by partner dental clinics since March 2017. On the Trusted Review Platform, the pilot tool of Dentacoin, there are already over 400 dental practices registered. The demand from dentists is growing organically without any market introduction. After the ICO, systematic market development is planned with part of the funds collected during the ICO.<\/p>\n<p>After the Presale in July 2017, Dentacoin has already been listed on various international exchange platforms and experienced a price increase of more than 10 times of the Presale price, even though it was announced in the Whitepaper and through all media that the ICO price will only be 3.5 times higher than the Presale price (Presale Price: 0.00003521 USD\/DCN, ICO Price: 0.00011723 USD\/DCN). <strong>Curious price development, indeed!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Therefore, the expectations for the price after the ICO are very high. Some experts expect to see a price increase by 20 to 100 times of the current ICO price. No one can make a reliable assessment; it\u2019s just about estimating the potential performance. <strong>If we look only at the parameters that can be estimated, we get to the following picture:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A few days after the ICO, Dentacoin will most likely be among the top 50 on CoinMarketCap, considering the circulating supply and the expected price. This estimation is solely based on historical data. If we just consider the highest market value achieved after the Presale 0.000587 USD\/DCN and multiply it with the circulating supply of approx. 318 billion DCN, we come to a market cap of approx. USD 187 million. As per the current order on CoinMarketCap (30.10.2017), that would place Dentacoin at 31st position. Even though the market capitalization order will experience changes, Dentacoin have the chances to reach a very important position from a strategic point of view. The daily trading volume is expected to exceed USD 100 000. On that note, a value of USD 0.001 \u2013 USD 0.005 per DCN can be reached. This is an eight-fold increase up to a fourty-fold increase in the ICO value.<\/p>\n<p>This simple estimation is just the fantasy of merchants based on historical data. Everything is possible in the crypto space. Many examples prove this. In many cases the value remains frozen at a low level, in other cases coins completely lose the ground under their feet. Some coins literally explode in value. Thus, each forecast should be perceived as a forecast and not as a promise.<\/p>\n<p>Dentacoin is a global concept with a long-term orientation. Many Dentacoin holders understand the long-term nature of the project and are not interested in the short-term performance. Day traders, on the other hand, are looking for quick profits and therefore, they are focused on short-term appreciation. For day traders, the last few days of the ICO are a great opportunity to gain significant value appreciation. <strong>Day trading can be beneficial and risky at the same time<\/strong>, because they cause enormous price fluctuations due to mass sales in a short period of time, which leads to temporary price collapses. Such price declines make long-term holders worried.<\/p>\n<p>Dentacoin has its solid basics for a successful long-term performance and a price of 0.01 USD\/DCN and higher is achievable in the long run. The hundred- or the thousand-fold increase in value is an elixir of dreams for anyone within the Blockchain community.<\/p>\n<p>Dentacoin represents a whole revolutionary movement within the global Healthcare sector. The powerful community around the project makes us believe that everything is possible. And there is a whole global industry to be changed out there...<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>He who has a lot of money can speculate. If you have little money, you can't speculate.

Around 15 billion DCN will be circulating additionally after the ICO.<\/p>\n<p>Dentacoin has been used as means of payment by partner dental clinics since March 2017. On the Trusted Review Platform, the pilot tool of Dentacoin, there are already over 400 dental practices registered. The demand from dentists is growing organically without any market introduction. After the ICO, systematic market development is planned with part of the funds collected during the ICO.<\/p>\n<p>After the Presale in July 2017, Dentacoin has already been listed on various international exchange platforms and experienced a price increase of more than 10 times of the Presale price, even though it was announced in the Whitepaper and through all media that the ICO price will only be 3.5 times higher than the Presale price (Presale Price: 0.00003521 USD\/DCN, ICO Price: 0.00011723 USD\/DCN). <strong>Curious price development, indeed!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Therefore, the expectations for the price after the ICO are very high. Some experts expect to see a price increase by 20 to 100 times of the current ICO price. No one can make a reliable assessment; it\u2019s just about estimating the potential performance. <strong>If we look only at the parameters that can be estimated, we get to the following picture:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A few days after the ICO, Dentacoin will most likely be among the top 50 on CoinMarketCap, considering the circulating supply and the expected price. This estimation is solely based on historical data. If we just consider the highest market value achieved after the Presale 0.000587 USD\/DCN and multiply it with the circulating supply of approx. 318 billion DCN, we come to a market cap of approx. USD 187 million. As per the current order on CoinMarketCap (30.10.2017), that would place Dentacoin at 31st position. Even though the market capitalization order will experience changes, Dentacoin have the chances to reach a very important position from a strategic point of view. The daily trading volume is expected to exceed USD 100 000. On that note, a value of USD 0.001 \u2013 USD 0.005 per DCN can be reached. This is an eight-fold increase up to a fourty-fold increase in the ICO value.<\/p>\n<p>This simple estimation is just the fantasy of merchants based on historical data. Everything is possible in the crypto space. Many examples prove this. In many cases the value remains frozen at a low level, in other cases coins completely lose the ground under their feet. Some coins literally explode in value. Thus, each forecast should be perceived as a forecast and not as a promise.<\/p>\n<p>Dentacoin is a global concept with a long-term orientation. Many Dentacoin holders understand the long-term nature of the project and are not interested in the short-term performance. Day traders, on the other hand, are looking for quick profits and therefore, they are focused on short-term appreciation. For day traders, the last few days of the ICO are a great opportunity to gain significant value appreciation. <strong>Day trading can be beneficial and risky at the same time<\/strong>, because they cause enormous price fluctuations due to mass sales in a short period of time, which leads to temporary price collapses. Such price declines make long-term holders worried.<\/p>\n<p>Dentacoin has its solid basics for a successful long-term performance and a price of 0.01 USD\/DCN and higher is achievable in the long run. The hundred- or the thousand-fold increase in value is an elixir of dreams for anyone within the Blockchain community.<\/p>\n<p>Dentacoin represents a whole revolutionary movement within the global Healthcare sector. The powerful community around the project makes us believe that everything is possible. And there is a whole global industry to be changed out there...<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>He who has a lot of money can speculate. If you have little money, you can't speculate.

By maintaining proper dental care and adhering to all recommendations within the app, users will receive incentives in the form of Dentacoin tokens.

Habit is what keeps you going.\u201d<br \/>\n- Jim Ryun<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What is the purpose of the app? Nowadays, it is proven that more than 90% of all dental problems can be prevented with regular check-ups, proper oral care and nutrition (according to the Australian Dental Association). This well-known but often neglected real-world problem is about to be counterattacked by the new mobile app of Dentacoin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Dentacare Mobile app aims to form long-lasting dental care habits through an intensive 3-month program in an engaging gamified environment.<\/strong> Through reminders, notifications, voice navigation and tutorials, users will be taught how to improve their dental hygiene and thus, form healthy habits. The app educates users how to brush, floss, rinse properly and advises them further on how to take proper care of their teeth with regular check-ups, better nutrition, etc.\u00a0An\u00a0emergency function implemented allows users to get advice from the dental specialists within the Dentacoin network in case of problems. The app is tremendously beneficial for children as well, as forming dental hygiene habits at a young age prevents the formation of deeper dental problems in future.<\/p>\n<p>The basic initial program lasts for 3 months, as it is considered that this is the time slot needed for a certain activity to be permanently integrated into the daily routine of an individual.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Call it what you will, incentives are what get people to work harder.\"<br \/>\n- Nikita Khrushchev<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Only after\u00a0maintaining a proper routine for a 3-month period, users will be rewarded with Dentacoin tokens, which they can later use for paying for dental services, dental care products, Dentacoin Assurance, or they can store them or\u00a0trade on exchange platforms and thus, benefit from the expected value multiplication.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The reward system, inherent in\u00a0each tool, is an important characteristic of the Dentacoin network. It serves as an initial trigger or motivation for participation in the network. The Dentacoin utility token plays a leading role here as it powers the whole Dentacoin network. It is used for rewarding network participants for their contribution to the foundation\u2019s mission; it is utilized as a united means of payment and ensures access to services provided within and across the network.<strong> To only have one currency within the network is also important because it creates value circulation through many ways of earning and spending Dentacoin and in the long term, gains value through a strong network effect, meaning that the value of the whole network increases with every new participant added to it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Through Dentacare app, both adults and children will be motivated to improve not only their dental health, but also their overall health. A fact often ignored is that dental health is directly related to the overall health condition of a person. <em>\u201cDental health is not something \u201cgood to have\u201d, yet not as important as another part of the body. Coming from the field of dentistry, we have seen first-hand how poor dental health could lead to an overall low quality of life. Problems with the gastrointestinal tract, the cardiovascular system, the nerve system form only a fraction of all problems linked to poor dental health. Thus, it is of the utmost importance for each individual to maintain high dental hygiene standards. People should be educated about the importance of proper dental care as a preventive measure and then they should be motivated to adhere to the recommendations and form healthy habits. Here gamification and reward systems are the \u201ckeywords\u201d to achieving the needed level of dental health awareness,\u201d\u00a0<\/em>comments Dr. Dimo Daskalov, leading dentist and educator in Prosthetic Dentistry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dentacare mobile app is already available on Google Play Store.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.dentacoin.dentacare&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1127\" src=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/en_badge_web_generic-300x116.png\" alt=\"Dentacare Mobile App by Dentacoin\" width=\"200\" height=\"77\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The iOS version of Dentacare is on its way as well.

By maintaining proper dental care and adhering to all recommendations within the app, users will receive incentives in the form of Dentacoin tokens. Dentacare is the second developed tool, serving the mission of Dentacoin, after the successfully launched <a href=\"https:\/\/reviews.dentacoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trusted Review Platform<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cMotivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.\u201d<br \/>\n- Jim Ryun<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What is the purpose of the app? Nowadays, it is proven that more than 90% of all dental problems can be prevented with regular check-ups, proper oral care and nutrition (according to the Australian Dental Association). This well-known but often neglected real-world problem is about to be counterattacked by the new mobile app of Dentacoin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Dentacare Mobile app aims to form long-lasting dental care habits through an intensive 3-month program in an engaging gamified environment.<\/strong> Through reminders, notifications, voice navigation and tutorials, users will be taught how to improve their dental hygiene and thus, form healthy habits. The app educates users how to brush, floss, rinse properly and advises them further on how to take proper care of their teeth with regular check-ups, better nutrition, etc.\u00a0An\u00a0emergency function implemented allows users to get advice from the dental specialists within the Dentacoin network in case of problems. The app is tremendously beneficial for children as well, as forming dental hygiene habits at a young age prevents the formation of deeper dental problems in future.<\/p>\n<p>The basic initial program lasts for 3 months, as it is considered that this is the time slot needed for a certain activity to be permanently integrated into the daily routine of an individual.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Call it what you will, incentives are what get people to work harder.\"<br \/>\n- Nikita Khrushchev<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Only after\u00a0maintaining a proper routine for a 3-month period, users will be rewarded with Dentacoin tokens, which they can later use for paying for dental services, dental care products, Dentacoin Assurance, or they can store them or\u00a0trade on exchange platforms and thus, benefit from the expected value multiplication.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The reward system, inherent in\u00a0each tool, is an important characteristic of the Dentacoin network. It serves as an initial trigger or motivation for participation in the network. The Dentacoin utility token plays a leading role here as it powers the whole Dentacoin network. It is used for rewarding network participants for their contribution to the foundation\u2019s mission; it is utilized as a united means of payment and ensures access to services provided within and across the network.<strong> To only have one currency within the network is also important because it creates value circulation through many ways of earning and spending Dentacoin and in the long term, gains value through a strong network effect, meaning that the value of the whole network increases with every new participant added to it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Through Dentacare app, both adults and children will be motivated to improve not only their dental health, but also their overall health. A fact often ignored is that dental health is directly related to the overall health condition of a person. <em>\u201cDental health is not something \u201cgood to have\u201d, yet not as important as another part of the body. Coming from the field of dentistry, we have seen first-hand how poor dental health could lead to an overall low quality of life. Problems with the gastrointestinal tract, the cardiovascular system, the nerve system form only a fraction of all problems linked to poor dental health. Thus, it is of the utmost importance for each individual to maintain high dental hygiene standards. People should be educated about the importance of proper dental care as a preventive measure and then they should be motivated to adhere to the recommendations and form healthy habits. Here gamification and reward systems are the \u201ckeywords\u201d to achieving the needed level of dental health awareness,\u201d\u00a0<\/em>comments Dr. Dimo Daskalov, leading dentist and educator in Prosthetic Dentistry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dentacare mobile app is already available on Google Play Store.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.dentacoin.dentacare&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"wp-image-1136 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/E-mail-cover-Dentacare.jpg\" alt=\"Dentacare Mobile App by Dentacoin\" width=\"820\" height=\"215\" \/><\/a>The iOS version of Dentacare is on its way as well.

I love the clich\u00e9 comparison of blockchain to the internet, in the way it allows people to become directly (no middle man) connected. The internet was also underestimated when it came about, with people thinking it wouldn\u2019t be used beyond military functions, and many predicting it would collapse (sounds familiar?). I definitely see the blockchain having use in healthcare with electronic health records (EHR). My work currently revolves around designing clinical decision support (CDS) into our regional EHR, and I\u2019ve seen firsthand the interoperability and security issues that plague EHRs and limit their communicability with each other.<\/p>\n<h4>Why did you decide to support Dentacoin as an Advisor?<\/h4>\n<p><em>Reed:<\/em> I was thrilled when I was approached to collaborate with Dentacoin. I am happy to get involved in blockchain projects in any way I can and especially excited about the possibilities for blockchain applications in healthcare. Presently working in the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, having some requisite knowledge, and being part of large care networks, I felt that Dentacoin was a project I would be able to add value to, as they embark on international development.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Honors &amp; Awards:<br \/>\n<\/strong>Hooper-Munroe Academic Award (2015)<br \/>\nLouise McKinney Award (2012, 2013, 2014)<br \/>\nDr Arturo Sanchez-Azofeifa &amp; Dr Christine Orosz Scholarship in Science (2014)<br \/>\nGovernor General\u2019s Bronze Academic Medal (2011)<br \/>\nValedictorian (2011)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Certifications:<\/strong><br \/>\nEpicCare Ambulatory EHR Proficiency<br \/>\neCLINICIAN EHR Training (Scheduling, Admin Support, Clinician Basics)<br \/>\nHealth Canada Div. 5 - Drugs For Clinical Trials Involving Human Subjects<br \/>\nNACTRC Coordinator Training (Weisler Research Inc.)<br \/>\nCITI Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC)<br \/>\nBLS-HCP CPR Level C, Heart and Stroke Foundation<br \/>\nAstraZeneca ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Proficiencies:<\/strong><br \/>\nREDCap: Survey Design &amp; Management, Data Entry<br \/>\nIBM SPSS Statistics Software<br \/>\nTableau Software: Business Intelligence and Analytics<br \/>\nWebsite Content Management (WordPress, Mezzanine, Squarespace)<br \/>\nHTML5 &amp; CSS3<\/p>\n<p><strong>Publications:<br \/>\n<\/strong>- Wierstra, R.

[24-Nov-2017 05:43:19 UTC] Making request POST https://api.medium.com/v1/publications//posts: {"title":"Report: Initial Effects of Using Dentacoin at F3T Dental Clinic, London","content":"<h1>Report: Initial Effects of Using Dentacoin at F3T Dental Clinic, London<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/DF3T-Report.jpg\" \/><br \/><p>Dentacoin, the Blockchain solution for the global dental industry, has already taken big steps towards its wide, real-world implementation. At the moment of writing, the first three tools of the Dentacoin Foundation are up-and-running: <a href=\"https:\/\/reviews.dentacoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trusted Review Platform<\/a> (with over 5000 registered users and more than 750 dental practices on board), <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.dentacoin.dentacare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dentacare Mobile App<\/a> (with more than 1500 unique users), <a href=\"https:\/\/dentavox.dentacoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DentaVox<\/a> Opinion Platform (Alpha version deployed). Dentacoin (DCN) is already implemented as means of payment at partner clinics in Europe and Asia and currently the team is negotiating with more potential partners, willing to implement DCN at their practices.<\/p>\n<p>We talked to Veselin Matov, practice manager of one of our partner clinics \u2013 F3T in London, UK \u2013 about their exciting initial experience with Dentacoin. Three major effects from implementing DCN have been monitored during the last months.<\/p>\n<h3>Dropout Rate Decrease<\/h3>\n<p>F3T Dental Clinic is devoted to fixed dental solutions for edentulous (without teeth) and partially edentulous patients. These treatments are usually performed within two main treatment stages and follow-up visits. The previous experience of F3T has shown an average dropout rate of 14% between the first and the second treatment stage and 11% - between the second and the subsequent visits.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1203\" style=\"width: 210px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Veselin-blog_1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1203\" src=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Veselin-blog_1-300x249.jpg\" alt=\"Veselin Matov, Dental Practice Manager at F3T Clinic, London talks to Dentacoin\" width=\"200\" height=\"166\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Veselin Matov, Dental Practice Manager at F3T Clinic, London<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe use of Dentacoin within our internal feedback system, followed by the recent implementation of the Trusted Review Platform, results in a differentiated evaluation of our work immediately after the treatment of each patient. It gives us essentially important hints for improvement. For this short period after implementing DCN, the dropout rate has been significantly \u00a0improved: \u00a0cancellations from first to second treatment stage are now 6% (compared to 14% before) and from the second to the following treatments \u2013 the change is from 11% to 7%.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Referral Rate Increase<\/h3>\n<p>Nowadays it is crucial for each business, especially within the service industry, to achieve a very high patient satisfaction level. Only patients that are truly excited, not only satisfied, are likely to recommend a service\/product to the people in their surroundings. The triggered word-of-mouth effect is essentially important to each business as it increases the number of customers coming from recommendations and thus lowers the customer acquisition costs.<\/p>\n<p>At F3T Dental Clinic, the referral rate overseen before the Dentacoin implementation was 62%. \u201cFor us it is very important to detect the best working patient acquisition channels. Therefore, in most of the cases we know with certainty how our patients have learnt about us. Since the trial launch of Dentacoin at our clinic, more and more patients are coming to F3T from referrals. We cannot yet give statistically verified figures for this but in my estimations improvement of the recommendation rate by at least 30% is present. Next year we will be able to show exact figures\u201d, shares Mr. Matov.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cSignificant changes in the communication behavior of the patients are evident. Thanks to Dentacoin, patients now have both the tribune to speak out and the motivation to do so\u201d.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>Positive Impact on the Customer Journey<\/h3>\n<p>Currently, F3T Dental Clinic is in a process of switching from their internal feedback system with DCN integration implemented to the Trusted Review Platform as more automated and secure solution. Their initial experience with implementing Dentacoin shows that by asking all patients to give their feedback, patients feel more integrated and deeply connected to the clinic. Simultaneously, they provide to the team\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/building-a-patient-driven-dental-industry-with-dentacoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">helpful advice for improvement of certain activities or processes<\/a>. Veselin Matov shares that through the Dentacoin tools, occasional patient dissatisfaction could be quickly identified and answered. \u201cWe have already optimized our communication behavior several times. It is interesting to note that the detailed feedback requested\u00a0from the patients gives us a clear picture which areas require special attention, \u00a0which person (doctor, assistant, practice manager, etc.) has a particularly positive influence, etc.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s not even all. Dentacoin marks positive impact on the customer journey through its newly developed mobile app as well. \u201cAt the moment we are also testing the beta version of Dentacare App. Our patients download the app while they are still at the practice. Most patients find this app very interesting and useful and are willing to recommend it to their children and grandchildren. The mobile app fits perfectly to our core mission: to improve dental health. It is very well perceived by our patients\u201d, explains Veselin Matov.<\/p>\n<p>Users receive Dentacoin (DCN) after adhering to all the recommendations within the app for three months as it is considered that this is the time slot needed for a certain habit to be established. Patients at F3T also earn DCN by providing the team with valuable, timely and constant feedback through the internal feedback system and\u00a0 the Trusted Review Platform. <strong>Then they can use the DCN collected to pay for part of their dental treatment. \u201cThis part is the favorite to each patient, of course.<\/strong> The ability to actually use the Dentacoin tokens makes this whole experience real. Checking the value against fiat currency, as well as the possibility to exchange DCN to other currencies like Bitcoin, Ether adds up to this feeling. I cannot deny that at first, due to lack of knowledge, the Dentacoin concept sounds a bit shocking especially to our elder patients. However, after properly explaining the use and the benefits of Dentacoin to them, and clarifying everything mentioned above, they are enthusiastic to join. We are all excited to monitor the future of Dentacoin\u201d, comments the practice manager of F3T Dental Clinic, London.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And what is the clinic doing with the collected Dentacoin tokens from treatment payments?<\/strong> \u201cWith more businesses implementing DCN, soon we will be able to buy dental materials and equipment with it. We are looking forward to having one united method of payment within the entire dental industry. This will significantly reduce costs, save time and benefit the patients. Having been strongly involved in the Dentacoin project development from the beginning and since I am aware of the common initial attitudes towards innovations in the sector, I know that it will take time until the concept is widely adopted. Therefore, we expect relevant increase in value only in the long run. At the moment, the most important thing is that the team is executing all plans in a timely manner and we at F3T are always ready to support them by sharing ideas and experience\", explains Matov.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, building a bridge between the innovative and little-known Blockchain technology and the conservative world of dentistry is indeed a real challenge\u2026 But it\u2019s happening. Tool by tool. Clinic by clinic. One step at a time. Thank you for moving forward with us!<\/p>\n","tags":["blockchain","dentacoin","dentaprime f3t","dentaprime london","dentistry","ethereum","f3t london"],"contentFormat":"html","canonicalUrl":"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/report-initial-effects-using-dentacoin-f3t-dental-clinic-london\/","license":null,"publishStatus":null,"publishedAt":"2017-11-22T08:50:42+00:00","notifyFollowers":false}

At the moment of writing, the first three tools of the Dentacoin Foundation are up-and-running: <a href=\"https:\/\/reviews.dentacoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trusted Review Platform<\/a> (with over 5000 registered users and more than 750 dental practices on board), <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.dentacoin.dentacare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dentacare Mobile App<\/a> (with more than 1500 unique users), <a href=\"https:\/\/dentavox.dentacoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DentaVox<\/a> Opinion Platform (Alpha version deployed). Dentacoin (DCN) is already implemented as means of payment at partner clinics in Europe and Asia and currently the team is negotiating with more potential partners, willing to implement DCN at their practices.<\/p>\n<p>We talked to Veselin Matov, practice manager of one of our partner clinics \u2013 F3T in London, UK \u2013 about their exciting initial experience with Dentacoin. Three major effects from implementing DCN have been monitored during the last months.<\/p>\n<h3>Dropout Rate Decrease<\/h3>\n<p>F3T Dental Clinic is devoted to fixed dental solutions for edentulous (without teeth) and partially edentulous patients. These treatments are usually performed within two main treatment stages and follow-up visits. The previous experience of F3T has shown an average dropout rate of 14% between the first and the second treatment stage and 11% - between the second and the subsequent visits.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1203\" style=\"width: 210px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Veselin-blog_1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1203\" src=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Veselin-blog_1-300x249.jpg\" alt=\"Veselin Matov, Dental Practice Manager at F3T Clinic, London talks to Dentacoin\" width=\"200\" height=\"166\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Veselin Matov, Dental Practice Manager at F3T Clinic, London<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe use of Dentacoin within our internal feedback system, followed by the recent implementation of the Trusted Review Platform, results in a differentiated evaluation of our work immediately after the treatment of each patient. It gives us essentially important hints for improvement. For this short period after implementing DCN, the dropout rate has been significantly \u00a0improved: \u00a0cancellations from first to second treatment stage are now 6% (compared to 14% before) and from the second to the following treatments \u2013 the change is from 11% to 7%.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Referral Rate Increase<\/h3>\n<p>Nowadays it is crucial for each business, especially within the service industry, to achieve a very high patient satisfaction level. Only patients that are truly excited, not only satisfied, are likely to recommend a service\/product to the people in their surroundings. The triggered word-of-mouth effect is essentially important to each business as it increases the number of customers coming from recommendations and thus lowers the customer acquisition costs.<\/p>\n<p>At F3T Dental Clinic, the referral rate overseen before the Dentacoin implementation was 62%. \u201cFor us it is very important to detect the best working patient acquisition channels. Therefore, in most of the cases we know with certainty how our patients have learnt about us. Since the trial launch of Dentacoin at our clinic, more and more patients are coming to F3T from referrals. We cannot yet give statistically verified figures for this but in my estimations improvement of the recommendation rate by at least 30% is present. Next year we will be able to show exact figures\u201d, shares Mr. Matov.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cSignificant changes in the communication behavior of the patients are evident. Thanks to Dentacoin, patients now have both the tribune to speak out and the motivation to do so\u201d.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>Positive Impact on the Customer Journey<\/h3>\n<p>Currently, F3T Dental Clinic is in a process of switching from their internal feedback system with DCN integration implemented to the Trusted Review Platform as more automated and secure solution. Their initial experience with implementing Dentacoin shows that by asking all patients to give their feedback, patients feel more integrated and deeply connected to the clinic. Simultaneously, they provide to the team\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/building-a-patient-driven-dental-industry-with-dentacoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">helpful advice for improvement of certain activities or processes<\/a>. Veselin Matov shares that through the Dentacoin tools, occasional patient dissatisfaction could be quickly identified and answered. \u201cWe have already optimized our communication behavior several times. It is interesting to note that the detailed feedback requested\u00a0from the patients gives us a clear picture which areas require special attention, \u00a0which person (doctor, assistant, practice manager, etc.) has a particularly positive influence, etc.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s not even all. Dentacoin marks positive impact on the customer journey through its newly developed mobile app as well. \u201cAt the moment we are also testing the beta version of Dentacare App. Our patients download the app while they are still at the practice. Most patients find this app very interesting and useful and are willing to recommend it to their children and grandchildren. The mobile app fits perfectly to our core mission: to improve dental health. It is very well perceived by our patients\u201d, explains Veselin Matov.<\/p>\n<p>Users receive Dentacoin (DCN) after adhering to all the recommendations within the app for three months as it is considered that this is the time slot needed for a certain habit to be established. Patients at F3T also earn DCN by providing the team with valuable, timely and constant feedback through the internal feedback system and\u00a0 the Trusted Review Platform. <strong>Then they can use the DCN collected to pay for part of their dental treatment. \u201cThis part is the favorite to each patient, of course.<\/strong> The ability to actually use the Dentacoin tokens makes this whole experience real. Checking the value against fiat currency, as well as the possibility to exchange DCN to other currencies like Bitcoin, Ether adds up to this feeling. I cannot deny that at first, due to lack of knowledge, the Dentacoin concept sounds a bit shocking especially to our elder patients. However, after properly explaining the use and the benefits of Dentacoin to them, and clarifying everything mentioned above, they are enthusiastic to join. We are all excited to monitor the future of Dentacoin\u201d, comments the practice manager of F3T Dental Clinic, London.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And what is the clinic doing with the collected Dentacoin tokens from treatment payments?<\/strong> \u201cWith more businesses implementing DCN, soon we will be able to buy dental materials and equipment with it. We are looking forward to having one united method of payment within the entire dental industry. This will significantly reduce costs, save time and benefit the patients. Having been strongly involved in the Dentacoin project development from the beginning and since I am aware of the common initial attitudes towards innovations in the sector, I know that it will take time until the concept is widely adopted. Therefore, we expect relevant increase in value only in the long run. At the moment, the most important thing is that the team is executing all plans in a timely manner and we at F3T are always ready to support them by sharing ideas and experience\", explains Matov.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, building a bridge between the innovative and little-known Blockchain technology and the conservative world of dentistry is indeed a real challenge\u2026 But it\u2019s happening. Tool by tool. Clinic by clinic. One step at a time.

DentaVox is the the 3rd tool of the Dentacoin Foundation, after the successfully launched <a href=\"https:\/\/reviews.dentacoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trusted Review Platform<\/a> (with over 5000 users on board) and <a href=\"https:\/\/themerkle.com\/dentacoins-dentacare-mobile-app-rewards-you-with-cryptocurrency-for-maintaining-proper-dental-care\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dentacare Mobile App<\/a> (with more than 1000 installs in the first week).<\/p>\n<p>DentaVox consists of questionnaires on variety of Healthcare topics with different length \u2013 from 8 to 100 questions, placed in an engaging interactive environment. The rewards in DCN are allocated according to the user efforts*. Smart mechanism detects the concentration of the users when filling in the surveys in order to guarantee high-quality results and prevent manipulations.<\/p>\n<p>DentaVox is a tribune for users to speak out, give their honest opinions, get rewarded and have a strong influence on the industry, as no one could ignore, delete or manipulate their true opinions. The statistics from each open questionnaire are visible to all registered users. They could then be used by dentists, suppliers, manufacturers, media as up-to-date, extremely valuable market research data and as a tool for constant service\/ treatment\/ product\/ process improvement. Thus, DentaVox provides benefits to all Dentacoin network participants.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThis is not the wisdom of the crowd, but the wisdom of someone in the crowd. It\u2019s not that the network itself is smart; it\u2019s that the individuals get smarter because they\u2019re connected to the network.\u201d - Steven Johnson<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A simple question on DentaVox Opinion Platform would be \u201cWould you consider wearing braces?\u201d or \u201cHow likely are you to travel 200 km to visit a dentist?\u201d. There are no right or wrong answers. You just give your honest opinion, make an impact and get rewarded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>These opinions, gathered in large quantities, form valuable collective customer intelligence which undoubtedly is the most important asset of every service industry.\u00a0<\/strong>Modern companies have already realized the utmost importance of bringing this collective intelligence into all business processes. The aim is to develop a co-creation process, where real and potential customers work together with the service\/product providers to create and optimize products, services, certain activities and processes on a daily basis. Only those providers remain relevant in the long term as they value the voice of the people who actually give them meaning.\u00a0There is only one requirement for properly using this valuable feedback: It requires willingness to change. But as we have already witnessed many times in history \u2013 only the most adaptive survive.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Success in management requires learning as fast as the world is changing.\" - Warren Bennis<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As a collective customer intelligence tool, DentaVox can be used for companies to learn more about the likeliness of clients to try a new product, the fears, the communication, payment options, referral likeliness, etc. <strong>These \u201cdetails\u201d are what makes or breaks a business.<\/strong> What\u2019s more, in the near future DentaVox will offer options for businesses to conduct custom surveys, based on a pre-targeted audience. For example: Wondering if you should expand your dental practices to another city? Create a survey and take the feedback and needs of people living in this exact region. How likely are your patients to buy a new product for a slightly higher price? Conduct a custom survey to people who are already using your product. Thinking about including a referral bonus? Ask people to see what they would prefer to get in return to their efforts to promote your brand\/business.<\/p>\n<p>The opportunities are immense. One thing is for sure: No matter how strong is the institutional control over a certain industry, nobody can control the customer experience and its tremendous impact on the industry. No regulatory authority, no central institution, no powerful organization or individual could control the industry better and stronger than the customer community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>READY TO SPEAK OUT?<\/strong> Go to <a href=\"http:\/\/dentavox.dentacoin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dentavox.dentacoin.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dentavox.dentacoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1159 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.dentacoin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/E-mail-cover-DentaVox.jpg\" alt=\"DentaVox Opinion Platform - Dentacoin\" width=\"820\" height=\"215\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>*Note:\u00a0 At the moment the platform accumulates relative values of Dentacoin tokens and withdrawal is not possible.

We entered the US market by partnering with LifDental (a dental chain with three dental practices in Buffalo, New York) and Aura Family Dentistry (a dental practice in Simi Valley, California). Moreover, another UK-based practice started accepting payments in DCN as well: Quality Affordable Dentistry, Hemel Hempstead.\u00a0Dentist3 (Selangor, Malaysia) and Daily Care Dental (Suva, Fiji) also joined our network.<\/p>\n<p>From the inquiries we received during the week, we also think it\u2019s important for us to emphasize on the following as well:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cryptopia is still under maintenance. \u201cCryptopia will be standing up new sister sites such as ltc.cryptopia.co.nz to handle base markets dedicated to LTC on their own trade engine and database to allow them to continue to trade, and allowing cryptopia.co.nz to resume registrations.\u201d (source: Cryptopia website https:\/\/www.cryptopia.co.nz\/News). However, you can still withdraw your Dentacoin tokens from Cryptopia.<\/li>\n<li>Due to high load and transaction security updates on DentaVox\/ Trusted Reviews, there are delays in the transactions. However, all pending transactions will be processed. If the transaction status is \u201cUnconfirmed\u201d, that means that once the updates are finished, you should initiate the transaction again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>On Wednesday, Jan 17, we had to\u00a0respond to one post on Reddit, filled with groundless statements.

The Managing Director Rahim Hirani and his team take pride for having a solid background in the field, which allows them to find the best fit for each practice through proven methods. At the moment the agency partners with over 150 dental practices across London and the home counties and is eager to introduce the benefits from Dentacoin to its expanding network.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPCP will aim to engage dental practices in London with the Dentacoin project and pick up further business development opportunities with new and existing practices. The project is aimed at our industry and is a unique offering. It offers exciting and innovative technology that could prove itself as profitable and efficient for dental practices around the globe. The potential is immeasurable at this stage, but with the number of dental practices in London alone, the opportunity is endless\u201d, shares Mr. Rahim Hirani, Managing Director at PCP Dental Recruitment.<\/p>\n<p>In future, they will also consider accepting payments in DCN for their professional recruitment services.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u201cExpanding the Dentacoin Network to all areas of the dental industry is crucial for the successful adoption of the concept.\u201d<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><em>- Tihomir Petrov, Business Developer at Dentacoin Foundation<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It is evident that the Dentacoin Network is growing daily.\u00a0As per this moment, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.dentacoin.com\/first-clinic-italy-implements-dentacoin-studio-odontoiatrico-dr-toia-busto-arsizio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fourteen dental clinics have already started accepting payments in DCN<\/a> and the number of dentists\/ dental practices registered on the Trusted Review Platform is over 900. Simultaneously, over 700 new active users of the tools (Trusted Reviews, Dentacare mobile app, DentaVox Research Platform) are acquired each week. This naturally leads to a growing interest from all other companies\u00a0operating within the industry as well.<\/p>\n<p>Building a community, consisting of dental professionals, patients, suppliers, dental laboratories, service agencies, is the essence of the Dentacoin concept. This newly-created network triggers network effects\u00a0meaning that each new participant increases the value of the network for all existing participants. Through numerous smart Blockchain-based solutions and a common industry-specific currency, all market participants are seamlessly connected, able to\u00a0efficiently cooperate with each other and to generate personal and mutual benefits. Here lies the greatest power of Dentacoin.

Here is what he shared to us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you decide to implement Dentacoin?<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Dr. Janash:<\/em> As an avid, early Bitcoin adopter, I think the possibilities for Blockchain in business are revolutionary and I have been eager to see it integrated into the dental industry. Cryptocurrencies are the future and our patients are always looking for the most advanced technologies available to help streamline and simplify their busy lives. In addition, as a health care provider, I\u2019m always looking to offer my patients options, both in clinical care and for payment of services. Dentacoin does just that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have you already presented Dentacoin to your patients? <\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Dr. Janash:<\/em> We have started to introduce it to patients. Most have heard of Bitcoin and are excited that we are the first in New York City to start accepting the coin. We are in the process of implementing the Dentacoin apps and websites into our in-house membership program. Once our team is trained and prepared to educate patients and answer all their questions, we will promote the initiative on all our channels, including our website, newsletters, and social platforms, and redirect patients to the review portal. Our goal is to educate and help make this an easy option for patients to use.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you see our future cooperation?<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Dr. Janash:<\/em> We would like to increase enrollment of patients into the platform and help to spread the word to other dentists and specialists in our networks. As more features are introduced, we look forward to exploring them!<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you estimate the future potential of the project? <\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Dr. Janash:<\/em> Tools that make it easier for patients to engage with the office and provide additional financial options, will result in better oral and overall health.

The Managing Director Rahim Hirani and his team take pride for having a solid background in the field, which allows them to find the best fit for each practice through proven methods. At the moment the agency partners with over 150 dental practices across London and the home counties and is eager to introduce the benefits from Dentacoin to its expanding network.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPCP will aim to engage dental practices in London with the Dentacoin project and pick up further business development opportunities with new and existing practices. The project is aimed at our industry and is a unique offering. It offers exciting and innovative technology that could prove itself as profitable and efficient for dental practices around the globe. The potential is immeasurable at this stage, but with the number of dental practices in London alone, the opportunity is endless\u201d, shares Mr. Rahim Hirani, Managing Director at PCP Dental Recruitment.<\/p>\n<p>In future, they will also consider accepting payments in DCN for their professional recruitment services.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u201cExpanding the Dentacoin Network to all areas of the dental industry is crucial for the successful adoption of the concept.\u201d<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><em>- Tihomir Petrov, Business Developer at Dentacoin Foundation<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It is evident that the Dentacoin Network is growing daily.\u00a0As per this moment, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.dentacoin.com\/first-clinic-italy-implements-dentacoin-studio-odontoiatrico-dr-toia-busto-arsizio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fourteen dental clinics have already started accepting payments in DCN<\/a> and the number of dentists\/ dental practices registered on the Trusted Review Platform is over 900. Simultaneously, over 700 new active users of the tools (Trusted Reviews, Dentacare mobile app, DentaVox Research Platform) are acquired each week. This naturally leads to a growing interest from all other companies\u00a0operating within the industry as well.<\/p>\n<p>Building a community, consisting of dental professionals, patients, suppliers, dental laboratories, service agencies, is the essence of the Dentacoin concept. This newly-created network triggers network effects\u00a0meaning that each new participant increases the value of the network for all existing participants. Through numerous smart Blockchain-based solutions and a common industry-specific currency, all market participants are seamlessly connected, able to\u00a0efficiently cooperate with each other and to generate personal and mutual benefits.

You just give your honest opinion, make an impact and get rewarded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>These opinions, gathered in large quantities, form valuable collective customer intelligence which undoubtedly is the most important asset of every service industry.\u00a0<\/strong>Modern companies have already realized the utmost importance of bringing this collective intelligence into all business processes. The aim is to develop a co-creation process, where real and potential customers work together with the service\/product providers to create and optimize products, services, certain activities and processes on a daily basis. Only those providers remain relevant in the long term as they value the voice of the people who actually give them meaning.\u00a0There is only one requirement for properly using this valuable feedback: It requires willingness to change. But as we have already witnessed many times in history \u2013 only the most adaptive survive.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Success in management requires learning as fast as the world is changing.\" - Warren Bennis<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As a collective customer intelligence tool, DentaVox can be used for companies to learn more about the likeliness of clients to try a new product, the fears, the communication, payment options, referral likeliness, etc. <strong>These \u201cdetails\u201d are what makes or breaks a business.<\/strong> What\u2019s more, in the near future DentaVox will offer options for businesses to conduct custom surveys, based on a pre-targeted audience. For example: Wondering if you should expand your dental practices to another city? Create a survey and take the feedback and needs of people living in this exact region. How likely are your patients to buy a new product for a slightly higher price? Conduct a custom survey to people who are already using your product. Thinking about including a referral bonus? Ask people to see what they would prefer to get in return to their efforts to promote your brand\/business.<\/p>\n<p>The opportunities are immense. One thing is for sure: No matter how strong is the institutional control over a certain industry, nobody can control the customer experience and its tremendous impact on the industry. No regulatory authority, no central institution, no powerful organization or individual could control the industry better and stronger than the customer community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>READY TO SPEAK OUT?<\/strong> Go to <a href=\"http:\/\/dentavox.dentacoin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dentavox.dentacoin.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dentavox.dentacoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1159 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.blog.dentacoin.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/E-mail-cover-DentaVox.jpg\" alt=\"DentaVox Opinion Platform - Dentacoin\" width=\"820\" height=\"215\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>*Note:\u00a0 At the moment the platform accumulates relative values of Dentacoin tokens and withdrawal is not possible.

When I heard about Dentacoin from a friend, I was eager to have a look at it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Leo Drakulic:\u200b<\/em> \u200b-When we first time saw the story about Dentacoin, it was really interesting for us. We think that these days, dentistry is really expensive for a lot of people especially here in Serbia.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>How do you see the integration of DCN in your practice?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Shariq ali Khan:\u200b <\/em>- Dentacoin is the first of its type that specifically caters the dental community, so for the sake of unity and future trends that might unite the dental community across the globe; I would like to name Dentacoin as primary cryptocurrency acceptable at my clinic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Leo Drakulic:<\/em>\u200b - We are still thinking how to implement it, but we decided to allow people to pay us in Dentacoin for these treatments: dental examinations, teeth cleaning, preventive dentistry, fillings, etc.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Have you already presented Dentacoin to your patients? If yes, what were their reactions?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Shariq ali Khan:<\/em> \u200b-I have talked about Dentacoin to few of my patients, and I hope they might make wallets and use it as a means to pay for dental treatment bills.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Leo Drakulic:<\/em> \u200b-We are starting to inform patients about new methods of payment. Younger patients, around 30, are very surprised to hear that we are accepting Dentacoin as a method of payment.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>If I am a patient of yours, how will I understand that you work with DCN? How will I receive more info? What's the process of me using DCN as a patient?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Shariq ali Khan:<\/em> \u200b- As my patient, I only request you to use 'My Ether Wallet' service, and then you can simply send DCN to our clinic wallet as a means of payment instead of paying by conventional currencies. This process is easy-to-use, quick and has a reliability factor added to it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Leo Drakulic:<\/em> \u200b-We will soon start to share with our patient,all about Dentacoin,and what are the benefits,how can they earn some DCN for free,etc.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>How do you see our future cooperation<wbr \/>? What are your expectations<wbr \/>?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Shariq ali Khan:<\/em> \u200b-I am excited to work with DCN and promote the use of this coin in the dental world. For I see that all dental treatments and purchases done via DCN may lead to a combined pool of money from all over the globe. That, on the other hand, would lead to stabilization and strengthening of the dental world as a whole. The different researches and reviews being done around the world, aim to educate as many people as possible with the concept and build trust in Dentacoins mission<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Leo Drakulic:<\/em> \u200b-We see our future with Dentacoin as very promising. These are only the first steps of Dentacoin and also our journey with DCN. We think that there is much more to be done, by both sides.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>How do you estimate the future potential of the project?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Shariq ali Khan:<\/em>\u200b -I hope that in coming one or two years, DCN should market and familiarize the patients and dental clinics with its use and the ease of its use, and I assume that at least 50% of the world's dental community should know about the name of Dentacoin by then.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Leo Drakulic:\u200b<\/em> -The potential is huge, but all of us that are united by this cause need to spread this story, become an ambassador ourselves and try to involve as many people as we can.<\/p>\n\t<hr>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>\n\t\t\tOriginally published at <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.dentacoin.com\/clinics-in-pakistan-and-serbia-accept-dentacoin-sherwanidental-and-lekodent\/\">Dentacoin blog<\/a>.\t\t<\/em>\n\t<\/p>\n\t","tags":["dcn","dentacoin","dentacoin accepted","dentacoin clinics","dentacoin dental practices","dentacoin in Pakistan","dentacoin partner clinics","detacoin in Serbia","LekoDent","SherwaniDental"],"contentFormat":"html","canonicalUrl":"https:\/\/blog.dentacoin.com\/clinics-in-pakistan-and-serbia-accept-dentacoin-sherwanidental-and-lekodent\/","license":"all-rights-reserved","publishStatus":"public","publishedAt":"2018-02-21T13:12:31+00:00","notifyFollowers":true}
